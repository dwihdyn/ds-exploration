      "jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardensâfinally when\n",

      "He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy\n",
      "straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\n",
      "supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\n",
      "dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\n",
      "aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\n",
      "clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyâhe seemed to fill\n",
      "those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\n",
      "see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\n",
      "thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverageâa cruel body.\n",
      "\n",
      "His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\n",
      "fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\n",
      "it, even toward people he likedâand there were men at New Haven who\n",
      "had hated his guts.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow, donât think my opinion on these matters is final,â he seemed to\n",
      "say, âjust because Iâm stronger and more of a man than you are.â We\n",
      "were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I\n",
      "always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\n",
      "him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n",

      "restlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the\n",
      "front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\n",
      "acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped\n",
      "the tide offshore.\n",
      "\n",

      "We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,\n",
      "fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The\n",
      "windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\n",
      "that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\n",
      "the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\n",
      "flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\n",
      "ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\n",
      "on it as wind does on the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\n",
      "couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\n",
      "anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\n",
      "rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\n",
      "short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\n",
      "listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\n",
      "picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\n",
      "rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\n",
      "curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\n",
      "length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\n",
      "chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\n",
      "was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\n",
      "she gave no hint of itâindeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\n",
      "an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to riseâshe leaned slightly\n",
      "forward with a conscientious expressionâthen she laughed, an absurd,\n",
      "charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm p-paralysed with happiness.â\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\n",
      "hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\n",
      "no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\n",
      "had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\n",
      "Baker. (Iâve heard it said that Daisyâs murmur was only to make people\n",
      "lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\n",

      "\n",
      "At any rate, Miss Bakerâs lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\n",
      "imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back againâthe object\n",
      "she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\n",
      "something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\n",

      "tribute from me.\n",

      "thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\n",
      "down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\n",
      "played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\n",
      "bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\n",
      "in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\n",
      "a singing compulsion, a whispered âListen,â a promise that she had\n",
      "done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\n",

      "\n",

      "given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that\n",
      "sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a\n",
      "greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had\n",

      "between the numbers people were doing âstuntsâ all over the garden,\n",
      "while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A\n",

      "weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\n",

must have you          thomas parke d   invilliers                                        i    in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice  that i   ve been turning over in my mind ever since        whenever you feel like criticizing anyone     he told me     just  remember that all the people in this world haven   t had the advantages  that you   ve had        he didn   t say any more  but we   ve always been unusually communicative  in a reserved way  and i understood that he meant a great deal more  than that  in consequence  i   m inclined to reserve all judgements  a  habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me  the victim of not a few veteran bores  the abnormal mind is quick to  detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal  person  and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of  being a politician  because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild   unknown men  most of the confidences were unsought   frequently i have  feigned sleep  preoccupation  or a hostile levity when i realized by  some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on  the horizon  for the intimate revelations of young men  or at least  the terms in which they express them  are usually plagiaristic and  marred by obvious suppressions  reserving judgements is a matter of  infinite hope  i am still a little afraid of missing something if i  forget that  as my father snobbishly suggested  and i snobbishly  repeat  a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out  unequally at birth     and  after boasting this way of my tolerance  i come to the admission  that it has a limit  conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the  wet marshes  but after a certain point i don   t care what it   s founded  on  when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted  the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever  i  wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the  human heart  only gatsby  the man who gives his name to this book  was  exempt from my reaction   gatsby  who represented everything for which i  have an unaffected scorn  if personality is an unbroken series of  successful gestures  then there was something gorgeous about him  some  heightened sensitivity to the promises of life  as if he were related  to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten  thousand miles away  this responsiveness had nothing to do with that  flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the     creative temperament      it was an extraordinary gift for hope  a  romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and  which it is not likely i shall ever find again  no   gatsby turned out  all right at the end  it is what preyed on gatsby  what foul dust  floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my  interest in the abortive sorrows and short winded elations of men                                                                                 my family have been prominent  well to do people in this middle  western city for three generations  the carraways are something of a  clan  and we have a tradition that we   re descended from the dukes of  buccleuch  but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather   s  brother  who came here in fifty one  sent a substitute to the civil  war  and started the wholesale hardware business that my father  carries on today     i never saw this great uncle  but i   m supposed to look like him   with  special reference to the rather hard boiled painting that hangs in  father   s office  i graduated from new haven in 1915  just a quarter of  a century after my father  and a little later i participated in that  delayed teutonic migration known as the great war  i enjoyed the  counter raid so thoroughly that i came back restless  instead of being  the warm centre of the world  the middle west now seemed like the  ragged edge of the universe   so i decided to go east and learn the bond  business  everybody i knew was in the bond business  so i supposed it  could support one more single man  all my aunts and uncles talked it  over as if they were choosing a prep school for me  and finally said      why   ye es     with very grave  hesitant faces  father agreed to finance  me for a year  and after various delays i came east  permanently  i  thought  in the spring of twenty two     the practical thing was to find rooms in the city  but it was a warm  season  and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly  trees  so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a  house together in a commuting town  it sounded like a great idea  he  found the house  a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a  month  but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington  and  i went out to the country alone  i had a dog   at least i had him for a  few days until he ran away   and an old dodge and a finnish woman  who  made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to  herself over the electric stove     it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man  more  recently arrived than i  stopped me on the road        how do you get to west egg village     he asked helplessly     i told him  and as i walked on i was lonely no longer  i was a guide   a pathfinder  an original settler  he had casually conferred on me the  freedom of the neighbourhood     and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the  trees  just as things grow in fast movies  i had that familiar  conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer     there was so much to read  for one thing  and so much fine health to  be pulled down out of the young breath giving air  i bought a dozen  volumes on banking and credit and investment securities  and they  stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint   promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and  maecenas knew  and i had the high intention of reading many other  books besides  i was rather literary in college   one year i wrote a  series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the yale news   and now  i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become  again that most limited of all specialists  the    well rounded man      this isn   t just an epigram   life is much more successfully looked at  from a single window  after all     it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of  the strangest communities in north america  it was on that slender  riotous island which extends itself due east of new york   and where  there are  among other natural curiosities  two unusual formations of  land  twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs  identical in  contour and separated only by a courtesy bay  jut out into the most  domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere  the great  wet barnyard of long island sound  they are not perfect ovals   like the  egg in the columbus story  they are both crushed flat at the contact  end   but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual  wonder to the gulls that fly overhead  to the wingless a more  interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular  except shape and size     i lived at west egg  the   well  the less fashionable of the two  though  this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little  sinister contrast between them  my house was at the very tip of the  egg  only fifty yards from the sound  and squeezed between two huge  places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season  the one on  my right was a colossal affair by any standard   it was a factual  imitation of some hã´tel de ville in normandy  with a tower on one  side  spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy  and a marble  swimming pool  and more than forty acres of lawn and garden  it was  gatsby   s mansion  or  rather  as i didn   t know mr  gatsby  it was a  mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name  my own house was an  eyesore  but it was a small eyesore  and it had been overlooked  so i  had a view of the water  a partial view of my neighbour   s lawn  and  the consoling proximity of millionaires   all for eighty dollars a  month     across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg  glittered along the water  and the history of the summer really begins  on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom  buchanans  daisy was my second cousin once removed  and i   d known tom  in college  and just after the war i spent two days with them in  chicago     her husband  among various physical accomplishments  had been one of  the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven   a  national figure in a way  one of those men who reach such an acute  limited excellence at twenty one that everything afterward savours of  anticlimax  his family were enormously wealthy   even in college his  freedom with money was a matter for reproach   but now he   d left chicago  and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away  for  instance  he   d brought down a string of polo ponies from lake  forest  it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was  wealthy enough to do that     why they came east i don   t know  they had spent a year in france for  no particular reason  and then drifted here and there unrestfully  wherever people played polo and were rich together  this was a  permanent move  said daisy over the telephone  but i didn   t believe  it   i had no sight into daisy   s heart  but i felt that tom would drift  on forever seeking  a little wistfully  for the dramatic turbulence of  some irrecoverable football game     and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east  egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all  their house  was even more elaborate than i expected  a cheerful red and white  georgian colonial mansion  overlooking the bay  the lawn started at  the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile   jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens   finally when  it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though  from the momentum of its run  the front was broken by a line of french  windows  glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm  windy afternoon  and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with  his legs apart on the front porch     he had changed since his new haven years  now he was a sturdy  straw haired man of thirty  with a rather hard mouth and a  supercilious manner  two shining arrogant eyes had established  dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning  aggressively forward  not even the effeminate swank of his riding  clothes could hide the enormous power of that body   he seemed to fill  those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing  and you could  see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his  thin coat  it was a body capable of enormous leverage   a cruel body     his speaking voice  a gruff husky tenor  added to the impression of  fractiousness he conveyed  there was a touch of paternal contempt in  it  even toward people he liked   and there were men at new haven who  had hated his guts        now  don   t think my opinion on these matters is final     he seemed to  say     just because i   m stronger and more of a man than you are     we  were in the same senior society  and while we were never intimate i  always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like  him with some harsh  defiant wistfulness of his own     we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch        i   ve got a nice place here     he said  his eyes flashing about  restlessly     turning me around by one arm  he moved a broad flat hand along the  front vista  including in its sweep a sunken italian garden  a half  acre of deep  pungent roses  and a snub nosed motorboat that bumped  the tide offshore        it belonged to demaine  the oil man     he turned me around again   politely and abruptly     we   ll go inside        we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy coloured space   fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end  the  windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside  that seemed to grow a little way into the house  a breeze blew through  the room  blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale  flags  twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the  ceiling  and then rippled over the wine coloured rug  making a shadow  on it as wind does on the sea     the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous  couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an  anchored balloon  they were both in white  and their dresses were  rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a  short flight around the house  i must have stood for a few moments  listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a  picture on the wall  then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the  rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room  and the  curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the  floor     the younger of the two was a stranger to me  she was extended full  length at her end of the divan  completely motionless  and with her  chin raised a little  as if she were balancing something on it which  was quite likely to fall  if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes  she gave no hint of it   indeed  i was almost surprised into murmuring  an apology for having disturbed her by coming in     the other girl  daisy  made an attempt to rise   she leaned slightly  forward with a conscientious expression   then she laughed  an absurd   charming little laugh  and i laughed too and came forward into the  room        i   m p paralysed with happiness        she laughed again  as if she said something very witty  and held my  hand for a moment  looking up into my face  promising that there was  no one in the world she so much wanted to see  that was a way she  had  she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was  baker   i   ve heard it said that daisy   s murmur was only to make people  lean toward her  an irrelevant criticism that made it no less  charming      at any rate  miss baker   s lips fluttered  she nodded at me almost  imperceptibly  and then quickly tipped her head back again   the object  she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her  something of a fright  again a sort of apology arose to my lips   almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned  tribute from me     i looked back at my cousin  who began to ask me questions in her low   thrilling voice  it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and  down  as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be  played again  her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it   bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth  but there was an excitement  in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget   a singing compulsion  a whispered    listen     a promise that she had  done gay  exciting things just a while since and that there were gay   exciting things hovering in the next hour     i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east   and how a dozen people had sent their love through me        do they miss me     she cried ecstatically        the whole town is desolate  all the cars have the left rear wheel  painted black as a mourning wreath  and there   s a persistent wail all  night along the north shore           how gorgeous  let   s go back  tom  tomorrow     then she added  irrelevantly     you ought to see the baby           i   d like to           she   s asleep  she   s three years old  haven   t you ever seen her           never           well  you ought to see her  she   s          tom buchanan  who had been hovering restlessly about the room  stopped  and rested his hand on my shoulder        what you doing  nick           i   m a bond man           who with        i told him        never heard of them     he remarked decisively     this annoyed me        you will     i answered shortly     you will if you stay in the east           oh  i   ll stay in the east  don   t you worry     he said  glancing at  daisy and then back at me  as if he were alert for something  more     i   d be a god damned fool to live anywhere else        at this point miss baker said     absolutely     with such suddenness that  i started   it was the first word she had uttered since i came into the  room  evidently it surprised her as much as it did me  for she yawned  and with a series of rapid  deft movements stood up into the room        i   m stiff     she complained     i   ve been lying on that sofa for as long  as i can remember           don   t look at me     daisy retorted     i   ve been trying to get you to  new york all afternoon           no  thanks     said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the  pantry     i   m absolutely in training        her host looked at her incredulously        you are     he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom  of a glass     how you ever get anything done is beyond me        i looked at miss baker  wondering what it was she    got done     i  enjoyed looking at her  she was a slender  small breasted girl  with  an erect carriage  which she accentuated by throwing her body backward  at the shoulders like a young cadet  her grey sun strained eyes looked  back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan  charming   discontented face  it occurred to me now that i had seen her  or a  picture of her  somewhere before        you live in west egg     she remarked contemptuously     i know somebody  there           i don   t know a single             you must know gatsby           gatsby     demanded daisy     what gatsby        before i could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced   wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine  tom buchanan compelled  me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square     slenderly  languidly  their hands set lightly on their hips  the two  young women preceded us out on to a rosy coloured porch  open toward  the sunset  where four candles flickered on the table in the  diminished wind        why candles     objected daisy  frowning  she snapped them out with her  fingers     in two weeks it   ll be the longest day in the year     she  looked at us all radiantly     do you always watch for the longest day  of the year and then miss it  i always watch for the longest day in  the year and then miss it           we ought to plan something     yawned miss baker  sitting down at the  table as if she were getting into bed        all right     said daisy     what   ll we plan     she turned to me  helplessly     what do people plan        before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her  little finger        look     she complained     i hurt it        we all looked   the knuckle was black and blue        you did it  tom     she said accusingly     i know you didn   t mean to   but you did do it  that   s what i get for marrying a brute of a man  a  great  big  hulking physical specimen of a             i hate that word   hulking          objected tom crossly     even in  kidding           hulking     insisted daisy     sometimes she and miss baker talked at once  unobtrusively and with a  bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter  that was as cool  as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all  desire  they were here  and they accepted tom and me  making only a  polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained  they knew  that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too  would be over and casually put away  it was sharply different from the  west  where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its  close  in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer  nervous dread of the moment itself        you make me feel uncivilized  daisy     i confessed on my second glass  of corky but rather impressive claret     can   t you talk about crops or  something        i meant nothing in particular by this remark  but it was taken up in  an unexpected way        civilization   s going to pieces     broke out tom violently     i   ve  gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things  have you read the rise  of the coloured empires by this man goddard           why  no     i answered  rather surprised by his tone        well  it   s a fine book  and everybody ought to read it  the idea is  if we don   t look out the white race will be   will be utterly  submerged  it   s all scientific stuff  it   s been proved           tom   s getting very profound     said daisy  with an expression of  unthoughtful sadness     he reads deep books with long words in  them  what was that word we             well  these books are all scientific     insisted tom  glancing at her  impatiently     this fellow has worked out the whole thing  it   s up to  us  who are the dominant race  to watch out or these other races will  have control of things           we   ve got to beat them down     whispered daisy  winking ferociously  toward the fervent sun        you ought to live in california       began miss baker  but tom  interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair        this idea is that we   re nordics  i am  and you are  and you are   and       after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a  slight nod  and she winked at me again        and we   ve produced all the  things that go to make civilization   oh  science and art  and all  that  do you see        there was something pathetic in his concentration  as if his  complacency  more acute than of old  was not enough to him any more   when  almost immediately  the telephone rang inside and the butler  left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned  towards me        i   ll tell you a family secret     she whispered enthusiastically      it   s about the butler   s nose  do you want to hear about the butler   s  nose           that   s why i came over tonight           well  he wasn   t always a butler  he used to be the silver polisher  for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred  people  he had to polish it from morning till night  until finally it  began to affect his nose             things went from bad to worse     suggested miss baker        yes  things went from bad to worse  until finally he had to give up  his position        for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her  glowing face  her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i  listened   then the glow faded  each light deserting her with lingering  regret  like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk     the butler came back and murmured something close to tom   s ear   whereupon tom frowned  pushed back his chair  and without a word went  inside  as if his absence quickened something within her  daisy leaned  forward again  her voice glowing and singing        i love to see you at my table  nick  you remind me of a   of a rose  an  absolute rose  doesn   t he     she turned to miss baker for confirmation      an absolute rose        this was untrue  i am not even faintly like a rose  she was only  extemporizing  but a stirring warmth flowed from her  as if her heart  was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless   thrilling words  then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and  excused herself and went into the house     miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of  meaning  i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said    sh      in a warning voice  a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the  room beyond  and miss baker leaned forward unashamed  trying to  hear  the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence  sank down   mounted excitedly  and then ceased altogether        this mr  gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour       i began        don   t talk  i want to hear what happens           is something happening     i inquired innocently        you mean to say you don   t know     said miss baker  honestly surprised      i thought everybody knew           i don   t           why       she said hesitantly     tom   s got some woman in new york           got some woman     i repeated blankly     miss baker nodded        she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time   don   t you think        almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a  dress and the crunch of leather boots  and tom and daisy were back at  the table        it couldn   t be helped     cried daisy with tense gaiety     she sat down  glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me  and  continued     i looked outdoors for a minute  and it   s very romantic  outdoors  there   s a bird on the lawn that i think must be a  nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line  he   s singing  away       her voice sang     it   s romantic  isn   t it  tom           very romantic     he said  and then miserably to me     if it   s light  enough after dinner  i want to take you down to the stables        the telephone rang inside  startlingly  and as daisy shook her head  decisively at tom the subject of the stables  in fact all subjects   vanished into air  among the broken fragments of the last five minutes  at table i remember the candles being lit again  pointlessly  and i  was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone  and yet to  avoid all eyes  i couldn   t guess what daisy and tom were thinking  but  i doubt if even miss baker  who seemed to have mastered a certain  hardy scepticism  was able utterly to put this fifth guest   s shrill  metallic urgency out of mind  to a certain temperament the situation  might have seemed intriguing   my own instinct was to telephone  immediately for the police     the horses  needless to say  were not mentioned again  tom and miss  baker  with several feet of twilight between them  strolled back into  the library  as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body  while   trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf  i followed  daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front  in  its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee     daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape  and  her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk  i saw that  turbulent emotions possessed her  so i asked what i thought would be  some sedative questions about her little girl        we don   t know each other very well  nick     she said suddenly     even  if we are cousins  you didn   t come to my wedding           i wasn   t back from the war           that   s true     she hesitated     well  i   ve had a very bad time  nick   and i   m pretty cynical about everything        evidently she had reason to be  i waited but she didn   t say any more   and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her  daughter        i suppose she talks  and   eats  and everything           oh  yes     she looked at me absently     listen  nick  let me tell you  what i said when she was born  would you like to hear           very much           it   ll show you how i   ve gotten to feel about   things  well  she was  less than an hour old and tom was god knows where  i woke up out of  the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling  and asked the nurse right  away if it was a boy or a girl  she told me it was a girl  and so i  turned my head away and wept    all right     i said    i   m glad it   s a  girl  and i hope she   ll be a fool   that   s the best thing a girl can be  in this world  a beautiful little fool           you see i think everything   s terrible anyhow     she went on in a  convinced way     everybody thinks so   the most advanced people  and i  know  i   ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything      her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way  rather like tom   s  and  she laughed with thrilling scorn     sophisticated   god  i   m  sophisticated        the instant her voice broke off  ceasing to compel my attention  my  belief  i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said  it made me  uneasy  as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to  exact a contributory emotion from me  i waited  and sure enough  in a  moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face  as  if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret  society to which she and tom belonged                                                                                 inside  the crimson room bloomed with light  tom and miss baker sat at  either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the  saturday evening post   the words  murmurous and uninflected  running  together in a soothing tune  the lamplight  bright on his boots and  dull on the autumn leaf yellow of her hair  glinted along the paper as  she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms     when we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand        to be continued     she said  tossing the magazine on the table     in  our very next issue        her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee  and she  stood up        ten o   clock     she remarked  apparently finding the time on the  ceiling     time for this good girl to go to bed           jordan   s going to play in the tournament tomorrow     explained daisy      over at westchester           oh   you   re jordan baker        i knew now why her face was familiar   its pleasing contemptuous  expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the  sporting life at asheville and hot springs and palm beach  i had heard  some story of her too  a critical  unpleasant story  but what it was i  had forgotten long ago        good night     she said softly     wake me at eight  won   t you           if you   ll get up           i will  good night  mr  carraway  see you anon           of course you will     confirmed daisy     in fact i think i   ll arrange a  marriage  come over often  nick  and i   ll sort of   oh   fling you  together  you know   lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push  you out to sea in a boat  and all that sort of thing             good night     called miss baker from the stairs     i haven   t heard a  word           she   s a nice girl     said tom after a moment     they oughtn   t to let  her run around the country this way           who oughtn   t to     inquired daisy coldly        her family           her family is one aunt about a thousand years old  besides  nick   s  going to look after her  aren   t you  nick  she   s going to spend lots  of weekends out here this summer  i think the home influence will be  very good for her        daisy and tom looked at each other for a moment in silence        is she from new york     i asked quickly        from louisville  our white girlhood was passed together there  our  beautiful white             did you give nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda      demanded tom suddenly        did i     she looked at me     i can   t seem to remember  but i think we  talked about the nordic race  yes  i   m sure we did  it sort of crept  up on us and first thing you know             don   t believe everything you hear  nick     he advised me     i said lightly that i had heard nothing at all  and a few minutes  later i got up to go home  they came to the door with me and stood  side by side in a cheerful square of light  as i started my motor  daisy peremptorily called     wait           i forgot to ask you something  and it   s important  we heard you were  engaged to a girl out west           that   s right     corroborated tom kindly     we heard that you were  engaged           it   s a libel  i   m too poor           but we heard it     insisted daisy  surprising me by opening up again  in a flower like way     we heard it from three people  so it must be  true        of course i knew what they were referring to  but i wasn   t even  vaguely engaged  the fact that gossip had published the banns was one  of the reasons i had come east  you can   t stop going with an old  friend on account of rumours  and on the other hand i had no intention  of being rumoured into marriage     their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely  rich   nevertheless  i was confused and a little disgusted as i drove  away  it seemed to me that the thing for daisy to do was to rush out  of the house  child in arms   but apparently there were no such  intentions in her head  as for tom  the fact that he    had some woman  in new york    was really less surprising than that he had been  depressed by a book  something was making him nibble at the edge of  stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his  peremptory heart     already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside  garages  where new red petrol pumps sat out in pools of light  and  when i reached my estate at west egg i ran the car under its shed and  sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard  the wind had  blown off  leaving a loud  bright night  with wings beating in the  trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth  blew the frogs full of life  the silhouette of a moving cat wavered  across the moonlight  and  turning my head to watch it  i saw that i  was not alone   fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of  my neighbour   s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets  regarding the silver pepper of the stars  something in his leisurely  movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested  that it was mr  gatsby himself  come out to determine what share was  his of our local heavens     i decided to call to him  miss baker had mentioned him at dinner  and  that would do for an introduction  but i didn   t call to him  for he  gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone   he stretched  out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way  and  far as i was  from him  i could have sworn he was trembling  involuntarily i glanced  seaward   and distinguished nothing except a single green light  minute  and far away  that might have been the end of a dock  when i looked  once more for gatsby he had vanished  and i was alone again in the  unquiet darkness                                         ii    about halfway between west egg and new york the motor road hastily  joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile  so as  to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land  this is a valley  of ashes   a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and  hills and grotesque gardens  where ashes take the forms of houses and  chimneys and rising smoke and  finally  with a transcendent effort  of  ash grey men  who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery  air  occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track   gives out a ghastly creak  and comes to rest  and immediately the  ash grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable  cloud  which screens their obscure operations from your sight     but above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift  endlessly over it  you perceive  after a moment  the eyes of doctor t   j  eckleburg  the eyes of doctor t  j  eckleburg are blue and  gigantic   their retinas are one yard high  they look out of no face   but  instead  from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass  over a nonexistent nose  evidently some wild wag of an oculist set  them there to fatten his practice in the borough of queens  and then  sank down himself into eternal blindness  or forgot them and moved  away  but his eyes  dimmed a little by many paintless days  under sun  and rain  brood on over the solemn dumping ground     the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river  and   when the drawbridge is up to let barges through  the passengers on  waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an  hour  there is always a halt there of at least a minute  and it was  because of this that i first met tom buchanan   s mistress     the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known  his  acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafã©s  with her and  leaving her at a table  sauntered about  chatting with  whomsoever he knew  though i was curious to see her  i had no desire  to meet her   but i did  i went up to new york with tom on the train one  afternoon  and when we stopped by the ash heaps he jumped to his feet  and  taking hold of my elbow  literally forced me from the car        we   re getting off     he insisted     i want you to meet my girl        i think he   d tanked up a good deal at luncheon  and his determination  to have my company bordered on violence  the supercilious assumption  was that on sunday afternoon i had nothing better to do     i followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence  and we walked  back a hundred yards along the road under doctor eckleburg   s  persistent stare  the only building in sight was a small block of  yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land  a sort of compact  main street ministering to it  and contiguous to absolutely nothing   one of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an  all night restaurant  approached by a trail of ashes  the third was a  garage   repairs  george b  wilson  cars bought and sold    and i followed  tom inside     the interior was unprosperous and bare  the only car visible was the  dust covered wreck of a ford which crouched in a dim corner  it had  occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind  and that  sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead  when the  proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office  wiping his hands  on a piece of waste  he was a blond  spiritless man  anaemic  and  faintly handsome  when he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his  light blue eyes        hello  wilson  old man     said tom  slapping him jovially on the  shoulder     how   s business           i can   t complain     answered wilson unconvincingly     when are you  going to sell me that car           next week  i   ve got my man working on it now           works pretty slow  don   t he           no  he doesn   t     said tom coldly     and if you feel that way about it   maybe i   d better sell it somewhere else after all           i don   t mean that     explained wilson quickly     i just meant          his voice faded off and tom glanced impatiently around the garage   then i heard footsteps on a stairs  and in a moment the thickish  figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door  she was  in the middle thirties  and faintly stout  but she carried her flesh  sensuously as some women can  her face  above a spotted dress of dark  blue crãªpe de chine  contained no facet or gleam of beauty  but there  was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of  her body were continually smouldering  she smiled slowly and  walking  through her husband as if he were a ghost  shook hands with tom   looking him flush in the eye  then she wet her lips  and without  turning around spoke to her husband in a soft  coarse voice        get some chairs  why don   t you  so somebody can sit down           oh  sure     agreed wilson hurriedly  and went toward the little  office  mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls  a  white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled  everything in the vicinity   except his wife  who moved close to tom        i want to see you     said tom intently     get on the next train           all right           i   ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level        she nodded and moved away from him just as george wilson emerged with  two chairs from his office door     we waited for her down the road and out of sight  it was a few days  before the fourth of july  and a grey  scrawny italian child was  setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track        terrible place  isn   t it     said tom  exchanging a frown with doctor  eckleburg        awful           it does her good to get away           doesn   t her husband object           wilson  he thinks she goes to see her sister in new york  he   s so  dumb he doesn   t know he   s alive        so tom buchanan and his girl and i went up together to new york   or not  quite together  for mrs  wilson sat discreetly in another car  tom  deferred that much to the sensibilities of those east eggers who might  be on the train     she had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin  which stretched  tight over her rather wide hips as tom helped her to the platform in  new york  at the newsstand she bought a copy of town tattle and a  moving picture magazine  and in the station drugstore some cold cream  and a small flask of perfume  upstairs  in the solemn echoing drive  she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one   lavender coloured with grey upholstery  and in this we slid out from  the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine  but immediately she  turned sharply from the window and  leaning forward  tapped on the  front glass        i want to get one of those dogs     she said earnestly     i want to get  one for the apartment  they   re nice to have   a dog        we backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to john  d  rockefeller  in a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very  recent puppies of an indeterminate breed        what kind are they     asked mrs  wilson eagerly  as he came to the  taxi window        all kinds  what kind do you want  lady           i   d like to get one of those police dogs  i don   t suppose you got  that kind        the man peered doubtfully into the basket  plunged in his hand and  drew one up  wriggling  by the back of the neck        that   s no police dog     said tom        no  it   s not exactly a police dog     said the man with disappointment  in his voice     it   s more of an airedale     he passed his hand over the  brown washrag of a back     look at that coat  some coat  that   s a dog  that   ll never bother you with catching cold           i think it   s cute     said mrs  wilson enthusiastically     how much is  it           that dog     he looked at it admiringly     that dog will cost you ten  dollars        the airedale   undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it  somewhere  though its feet were startlingly white   changed hands and  settled down into mrs  wilson   s lap  where she fondled the  weatherproof coat with rapture        is it a boy or a girl     she asked delicately        that dog  that dog   s a boy           it   s a bitch     said tom decisively     here   s your money  go and buy  ten more dogs with it        we drove over to fifth avenue  warm and soft  almost pastoral  on the  summer sunday afternoon  i wouldn   t have been surprised to see a great  flock of white sheep turn the corner        hold on     i said     i have to leave you here           no you don   t     interposed tom quickly     myrtle   ll be hurt if you  don   t come up to the apartment  won   t you  myrtle           come on     she urged     i   ll telephone my sister catherine  she   s said  to be very beautiful by people who ought to know           well  i   d like to  but          we went on  cutting back again over the park toward the west hundreds   at 158th street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of  apartment houses  throwing a regal homecoming glance around the  neighbourhood  mrs  wilson gathered up her dog and her other  purchases  and went haughtily in        i   m going to have the mckees come up     she announced as we rose in  the elevator     and  of course  i got to call up my sister  too        the apartment was on the top floor   a small living room  a small  dining room  a small bedroom  and a bath  the living room was crowded  to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for  it  so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of  ladies swinging in the gardens of versailles  the only picture was an  over enlarged photograph  apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock   looked at from a distance  however  the hen resolved itself into a  bonnet  and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the  room  several old copies of town tattle lay on the table together with  a copy of simon called peter  and some of the small scandal magazines  of broadway  mrs  wilson was first concerned with the dog  a reluctant  elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk  to which he  added on his own initiative a tin of large  hard dog biscuits   one of  which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all  afternoon  meanwhile tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked  bureau door     i have been drunk just twice in my life  and the second time was that  afternoon  so everything that happened has a dim  hazy cast over it   although until after eight o   clock the apartment was full of cheerful  sun  sitting on tom   s lap mrs  wilson called up several people on the  telephone  then there were no cigarettes  and i went out to buy some  at the drugstore on the corner  when i came back they had both  disappeared  so i sat down discreetly in the living room and read a  chapter of simon called peter   either it was terrible stuff or the  whisky distorted things  because it didn   t make any sense to me     just as tom and myrtle  after the first drink mrs  wilson and i called  each other by our first names  reappeared  company commenced to arrive  at the apartment door     the sister  catherine  was a slender  worldly girl of about thirty   with a solid  sticky bob of red hair  and a complexion powdered milky  white  her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more  rakish angle  but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the  old alignment gave a blurred air to her face  when she moved about  there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets  jingled up and down upon her arms  she came in with such a proprietary  haste  and looked around so possessively at the furniture that i  wondered if she lived here  but when i asked her she laughed  immoderately  repeated my question aloud  and told me she lived with a  girl friend at a hotel     mr  mckee was a pale  feminine man from the flat below  he had just  shaved  for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone  and he  was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room  he  informed me that he was in the    artistic game     and i gathered later  that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of  mrs  wilson   s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall  his  wife was shrill  languid  handsome  and horrible  she told me with  pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty seven  times since they had been married     mrs  wilson had changed her costume some time before  and was now  attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream coloured chiffon   which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room  with  the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a  change  the intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage  was converted into impressive hauteur  her laughter  her gestures  her  assertions became more violently affected moment by moment  and as she  expanded the room grew smaller around her  until she seemed to be  revolving on a noisy  creaking pivot through the smoky air        my dear     she told her sister in a high  mincing shout     most of  these fellas will cheat you every time  all they think of is money  i  had a woman up here last week to look at my feet  and when she gave me  the bill you   d of thought she had my appendicitis out           what was the name of the woman     asked mrs  mckee        mrs  eberhardt  she goes around looking at people   s feet in their own  homes           i like your dress     remarked mrs  mckee     i think it   s adorable        mrs  wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain        it   s just a crazy old thing     she said     i just slip it on sometimes  when i don   t care what i look like           but it looks wonderful on you  if you know what i mean     pursued mrs   mckee     if chester could only get you in that pose i think he could  make something of it        we all looked in silence at mrs  wilson  who removed a strand of hair  from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile  mr   mckee regarded her intently with his head on one side  and then moved  his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face        i should change the light     he said after a moment     i   d like to  bring out the modelling of the features  and i   d try to get hold of  all the back hair           i wouldn   t think of changing the light     cried mrs  mckee     i think  it   s          her husband said    sh     and we all looked at the subject again   whereupon tom buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet        you mckees have something to drink     he said     get some more ice and  mineral water  myrtle  before everybody goes to sleep           i told that boy about the ice     myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair  at the shiftlessness of the lower orders     these people  you have to  keep after them all the time        she looked at me and laughed pointlessly  then she flounced over to  the dog  kissed it with ecstasy  and swept into the kitchen  implying  that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there        i   ve done some nice things out on long island     asserted mr  mckee     tom looked at him blankly        two of them we have framed downstairs           two what     demanded tom        two studies  one of them i call montauk point   the gulls  and the  other i call montauk point   the sea        the sister catherine sat down beside me on the couch        do you live down on long island  too     she inquired        i live at west egg           really  i was down there at a party about a month ago  at a man named  gatsby   s  do you know him           i live next door to him           well  they say he   s a nephew or a cousin of kaiser wilhelm   s  that   s  where all his money comes from           really        she nodded        i   m scared of him  i   d hate to have him get anything on me        this absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by mrs   mckee   s pointing suddenly at catherine        chester  i think you could do something with her     she broke out  but  mr  mckee only nodded in a bored way  and turned his attention to tom        i   d like to do more work on long island  if i could get the entry   all i ask is that they should give me a start           ask myrtle     said tom  breaking into a short shout of laughter as  mrs  wilson entered with a tray     she   ll give you a letter of  introduction  won   t you  myrtle           do what     she asked  startled        you   ll give mckee a letter of introduction to your husband  so he can  do some studies of him     his lips moved silently for a moment as he  invented         george b  wilson at the gasoline pump     or something like  that        catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear        neither of them can stand the person they   re married to           can   t they           can   t stand them     she looked at myrtle and then at tom     what i say  is  why go on living with them if they can   t stand them  if i was them  i   d get a divorce and get married to each other right away           doesn   t she like wilson either        the answer to this was unexpected  it came from myrtle  who had  overheard the question  and it was violent and obscene        you see     cried catherine triumphantly  she lowered her voice again      it   s really his wife that   s keeping them apart  she   s a catholic  and  they don   t believe in divorce        daisy was not a catholic  and i was a little shocked at the  elaborateness of the lie        when they do get married     continued catherine     they   re going west  to live for a while until it blows over           it   d be more discreet to go to europe           oh  do you like europe     she exclaimed surprisingly     i just got back  from monte carlo           really           just last year  i went over there with another girl           stay long           no  we just went to monte carlo and back  we went by way of  marseilles  we had over twelve hundred dollars when we started  but we  got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms  we had an  awful time getting back  i can tell you  god  how i hated that town        the late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the  blue honey of the mediterranean   then the shrill voice of mrs  mckee  called me back into the room        i almost made a mistake  too     she declared vigorously     i almost  married a little kike who   d been after me for years  i knew he was  below me  everybody kept saying to me    lucille  that man   s way below  you     but if i hadn   t met chester  he   d of got me sure           yes  but listen     said myrtle wilson  nodding her head up and down      at least you didn   t marry him           i know i didn   t           well  i married him     said myrtle  ambiguously     and that   s the  difference between your case and mine           why did you  myrtle     demanded catherine     nobody forced you to        myrtle considered        i married him because i thought he was a gentleman     she said  finally     i thought he knew something about breeding  but he wasn   t  fit to lick my shoe           you were crazy about him for a while     said catherine        crazy about him     cried myrtle incredulously     who said i was crazy  about him  i never was any more crazy about him than i was about that  man there        she pointed suddenly at me  and everyone looked at me accusingly  i  tried to show by my expression that i expected no affection        the only crazy i was was when i married him  i knew right away i made  a mistake  he borrowed somebody   s best suit to get married in  and  never even told me about it  and the man came after it one day when he  was out    oh  is that your suit     i said    this is the first i ever  heard about it     but i gave it to him and then i lay down and cried to  beat the band all afternoon           she really ought to get away from him     resumed catherine to me      they   ve been living over that garage for eleven years  and tom   s the  first sweetie she ever had        the bottle of whisky   a second one   was now in constant demand by all  present  excepting catherine  who    felt just as good on nothing at  all     tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated  sandwiches  which were a complete supper in themselves  i wanted to  get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight   but each time i tried to go i became entangled in some wild  strident  argument which pulled me back  as if with ropes  into my chair  yet  high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed  their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening  streets  and i saw him too  looking up and wondering  i was within and  without  simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible  variety of life     myrtle pulled her chair close to mine  and suddenly her warm breath  poured over me the story of her first meeting with tom        it was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the  last ones left on the train  i was going up to new york to see my  sister and spend the night  he had on a dress suit and patent leather  shoes  and i couldn   t keep my eyes off him  but every time he looked  at me i had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his  head  when we came into the station he was next to me  and his white  shirtfront pressed against my arm  and so i told him i   d have to call  a policeman  but he knew i lied  i was so excited that when i got into  a taxi with him i didn   t hardly know i wasn   t getting into a subway  train  all i kept thinking about  over and over  was   you can   t live  forever  you can   t live forever             she turned to mrs  mckee and the room rang full of her artificial  laughter        my dear     she cried     i   m going to give you this dress as soon as i   m  through with it  i   ve got to get another one tomorrow  i   m going to  make a list of all the things i   ve got to get  a massage and a wave   and a collar for the dog  and one of those cute little ashtrays where  you touch a spring  and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother   s  grave that   ll last all summer  i got to write down a list so i won   t  forget all the things i got to do        it was nine o   clock   almost immediately afterward i looked at my watch  and found it was ten  mr  mckee was asleep on a chair with his fists  clenched in his lap  like a photograph of a man of action  taking out  my handkerchief i wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that  had worried me all the afternoon     the little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes  through the smoke  and from time to time groaning faintly  people  disappeared  reappeared  made plans to go somewhere  and then lost  each other  searched for each other  found each other a few feet  away  some time toward midnight tom buchanan and mrs  wilson stood  face to face discussing  in impassioned voices  whether mrs  wilson  had any right to mention daisy   s name        daisy  daisy  daisy     shouted mrs  wilson     i   ll say it whenever i  want to  daisy  dai          making a short deft movement  tom buchanan broke her nose with his  open hand     then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor  and women   s  voices scolding  and high over the confusion a long broken wail of  pain  mr  mckee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the  door  when he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the  scene   his wife and catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled  here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid  and  the despairing figure on the couch  bleeding fluently  and trying to  spread a copy of town tattle over the tapestry scenes of  versailles  then mr  mckee turned and continued on out the door   taking my hat from the chandelier  i followed        come to lunch some day     he suggested  as we groaned down in the  elevator        where           anywhere           keep your hands off the lever     snapped the elevator boy        i beg your pardon     said mr  mckee with dignity     i didn   t know i was  touching it           all right     i agreed     i   ll be glad to          ¦ i was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the  sheets  clad in his underwear  with a great portfolio in his hands        beauty and the beast   ¦ loneliness   ¦ old grocery horse   ¦ brook   n  bridge   ¦       then i was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the  pennsylvania station  staring at the morning tribune  and waiting for  the four o   clock train                                        iii    there was music from my neighbour   s house through the summer nights   in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the  whisperings and the champagne and the stars  at high tide in the  afternoon i watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft  or  taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats  slit the waters of the sound  drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of  foam  on weekends his rolls royce became an omnibus  bearing parties  to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past  midnight  while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to  meet all trains  and on mondays eight servants  including an extra  gardener  toiled all day with mops and scrubbing brushes and hammers  and garden shears  repairing the ravages of the night before     every friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a  fruiterer in new york   every monday these same oranges and lemons left  his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves  there was a machine in  the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in  half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a  butler   s thumb     at least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several  hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a christmas  tree of gatsby   s enormous garden  on buffet tables  garnished with  glistening hors d   oeuvre  spiced baked hams crowded against salads of  harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark  gold  in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up  and  stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that  most of his female guests were too young to know one from another     by seven o   clock the orchestra has arrived  no thin five piece affair   but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and  cornets and piccolos  and low and high drums  the last swimmers have  come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs  the cars from  new york are parked five deep in the drive  and already the halls and  salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours  and hair bobbed in  strange new ways  and shawls beyond the dreams of castile  the bar is  in full swing  and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden  outside  until the air is alive with chatter and laughter  and casual  innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot  and enthusiastic  meetings between women who never knew each other   s names     the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun  and  now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music  and the opera of  voices pitches a key higher  laughter is easier minute by minute   spilled with prodigality  tipped out at a cheerful word  the groups  change more swiftly  swell with new arrivals  dissolve and form in the  same breath  already there are wanderers  confident girls who weave  here and there among the stouter and more stable  become for a sharp   joyous moment the centre of a group  and then  excited with triumph   glide on through the sea change of faces and voices and colour under  the constantly changing light     suddenly one of these gypsies  in trembling opal  seizes a cocktail  out of the air  dumps it down for courage and  moving her hands like  frisco  dances out alone on the canvas platform  a momentary hush  the  orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her  and there is a  burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is gilda  gray   s understudy from the follies  the party has begun     i believe that on the first night i went to gatsby   s house i was one  of the few guests who had actually been invited  people were not  invited   they went there  they got into automobiles which bore them out  to long island  and somehow they ended up at gatsby   s door  once there  they were introduced by somebody who knew gatsby  and after that they  conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated  with an amusement park  sometimes they came and went without having  met gatsby at all  came for the party with a simplicity of heart that  was its own ticket of admission     i had been actually invited  a chauffeur in a uniform of robin   s egg  blue crossed my lawn early that saturday morning with a surprisingly  formal note from his employer  the honour would be entirely gatsby   s   it said  if i would attend his    little party    that night  he had seen  me several times  and had intended to call on me long before  but a  peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it   signed jay  gatsby  in a majestic hand     dressed up in white flannels i went over to his lawn a little after  seven  and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies  of people i didn   t know   though here and there was a face i had noticed  on the commuting train  i was immediately struck by the number of  young englishmen dotted about  all well dressed  all looking a little  hungry  and all talking in low  earnest voices to solid and prosperous  americans  i was sure that they were selling something  bonds or  insurance or automobiles  they were at least agonizingly aware of the  easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few  words in the right key     as soon as i arrived i made an attempt to find my host  but the two or  three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an  amazed way  and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements   that i slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table   the only place  in the garden where a single man could linger without looking  purposeless and alone     i was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when  jordan baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble  steps  leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous  interest down into the garden     welcome or not  i found it necessary to attach myself to someone  before i should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby        hello     i roared  advancing toward her  my voice seemed unnaturally  loud across the garden        i thought you might be here     she responded absently as i came up      i remembered you lived next door to          she held my hand impersonally  as a promise that she   d take care of me  in a minute  and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses  who  stopped at the foot of the steps        hello     they cried together     sorry you didn   t win        that was for the golf tournament  she had lost in the finals the week  before        you don   t know who we are     said one of the girls in yellow     but we  met you here about a month ago           you   ve dyed your hair since then     remarked jordan  and i started   but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to  the premature moon  produced like the supper  no doubt  out of a  caterer   s basket  with jordan   s slender golden arm resting in mine  we  descended the steps and sauntered about the garden  a tray of  cocktails floated at us through the twilight  and we sat down at a  table with the two girls in yellow and three men  each one introduced  to us as mr  mumble        do you come to these parties often     inquired jordan of the girl  beside her        the last one was the one i met you at     answered the girl  in an  alert confident voice  she turned to her companion     wasn   t it for  you  lucille        it was for lucille  too        i like to come     lucille said     i never care what i do  so i always  have a good time  when i was here last i tore my gown on a chair  and  he asked me my name and address   inside of a week i got a package from  croirier   s with a new evening gown in it           did you keep it     asked jordan        sure i did  i was going to wear it tonight  but it was too big in the  bust and had to be altered  it was gas blue with lavender beads  two  hundred and sixty five dollars           there   s something funny about a fellow that   ll do a thing like that      said the other girl eagerly     he doesn   t want any trouble with  anybody           who doesn   t     i inquired        gatsby  somebody told me          the two girls and jordan leaned together confidentially        somebody told me they thought he killed a man once        a thrill passed over all of us  the three mr  mumbles bent forward and  listened eagerly        i don   t think it   s so much that     argued lucille sceptically     it   s  more that he was a german spy during the war        one of the men nodded in confirmation        i heard that from a man who knew all about him  grew up with him in  germany     he assured us positively        oh  no     said the first girl     it couldn   t be that  because he was in  the american army during the war     as our credulity switched back to  her she leaned forward with enthusiasm     you look at him sometimes  when he thinks nobody   s looking at him  i   ll bet he killed a man        she narrowed her eyes and shivered  lucille shivered  we all turned  and looked around for gatsby  it was testimony to the romantic  speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those  who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this  world     the first supper   there would be another one after midnight   was now  being served  and jordan invited me to join her own party  who were  spread around a table on the other side of the garden  there were  three married couples and jordan   s escort  a persistent undergraduate  given to violent innuendo  and obviously under the impression that  sooner or later jordan was going to yield him up her person to a  greater or lesser degree  instead of rambling  this party had  preserved a dignified homogeneity  and assumed to itself the function  of representing the staid nobility of the countryside   east egg  condescending to west egg and carefully on guard against its  spectroscopic gaiety        let   s get out     whispered jordan  after a somehow wasteful and  inappropriate half hour     this is much too polite for me        we got up  and she explained that we were going to find the host  i  had never met him  she said  and it was making me uneasy  the  undergraduate nodded in a cynical  melancholy way     the bar  where we glanced first  was crowded  but gatsby was not  there  she couldn   t find him from the top of the steps  and he wasn   t  on the veranda  on a chance we tried an important looking door  and  walked into a high gothic library  panelled with carved english oak   and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas     a stout  middle aged man  with enormous owl eyed spectacles  was  sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table  staring with  unsteady concentration at the shelves of books  as we entered he  wheeled excitedly around and examined jordan from head to foot        what do you think     he demanded impetuously        about what        he waved his hand toward the bookshelves        about that  as a matter of fact you needn   t bother to ascertain  i  ascertained  they   re real           the books        he nodded        absolutely real   have pages and everything  i thought they   d be a nice  durable cardboard  matter of fact  they   re absolutely real   pages  and   here  lemme show you        taking our scepticism for granted  he rushed to the bookcases and  returned with volume one of the stoddard lectures        see     he cried triumphantly     it   s a bona fide piece of printed  matter  it fooled me  this fella   s a regular belasco  it   s a  triumph  what thoroughness  what realism  knew when to stop   too   didn   t cut the pages  but what do you want  what do you expect        he snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf   muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable  to collapse        who brought you     he demanded     or did you just come  i was brought   most people were brought        jordan looked at him alertly  cheerfully  without answering        i was brought by a woman named roosevelt     he continued     mrs  claud  roosevelt  do you know her  i met her somewhere last night  i   ve been  drunk for about a week now  and i thought it might sober me up to sit  in a library           has it           a little bit  i think  i can   t tell yet  i   ve only been here an hour   did i tell you about the books  they   re real  they   re             you told us        we shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors     there was dancing now on the canvas in the garden  old men pushing  young girls backward in eternal graceless circles  superior couples  holding each other tortuously  fashionably  and keeping in the  corners   and a great number of single girls dancing individually or  relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the  traps  by midnight the hilarity had increased  a celebrated tenor had  sung in italian  and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz  and  between the numbers people were doing    stunts    all over the garden   while happy  vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky  a  pair of stage twins  who turned out to be the girls in yellow  did a  baby act in costume  and champagne was served in glasses bigger than  finger bowls  the moon had risen higher  and floating in the sound was  a triangle of silver scales  trembling a little to the stiff  tinny  drip of the banjoes on the lawn     i was still with jordan baker  we were sitting at a table with a man  of about my age and a rowdy little girl  who gave way upon the  slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter  i was enjoying  myself now  i had taken two finger bowls of champagne  and the scene  had changed before my eyes into something significant  elemental  and  profound     at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled        your face is familiar     he said politely     weren   t you in the first  division during the war           why yes  i was in the twenty eighth infantry           i was in the sixteenth until june nineteen eighteen  i knew i   d seen  you somewhere before        we talked for a moment about some wet  grey little villages in france   evidently he lived in this vicinity  for he told me that he had just  bought a hydroplane  and was going to try it out in the morning        want to go with me  old sport  just near the shore along the sound           what time           any time that suits you best        it was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when jordan looked  around and smiled        having a gay time now     she inquired        much better     i turned again to my new acquaintance     this is an  unusual party for me  i haven   t even seen the host  i live over  there       i waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance     and  this man gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation        for a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand        i   m gatsby     he said suddenly        what     i exclaimed     oh  i beg your pardon           i thought you knew  old sport  i   m afraid i   m not a very good host        he smiled understandingly   much more than understandingly  it was one  of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it  that  you may come across four or five times in life  it faced   or seemed to  face   the whole eternal world for an instant  and then concentrated on  you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour  it understood you  just so far as you wanted to be understood  believed in you as you  would like to believe in yourself  and assured you that it had  precisely the impression of you that  at your best  you hoped to  convey  precisely at that point it vanished   and i was looking at an  elegant young roughneck  a year or two over thirty  whose elaborate  formality of speech just missed being absurd  some time before he  introduced himself i   d got a strong impression that he was picking his  words with care     almost at the moment when mr  gatsby identified himself a butler  hurried toward him with the information that chicago was calling him  on the wire  he excused himself with a small bow that included each of  us in turn        if you want anything just ask for it  old sport     he urged me      excuse me  i will rejoin you later        when he was gone i turned immediately to jordan   constrained to assure  her of my surprise  i had expected that mr  gatsby would be a florid  and corpulent person in his middle years        who is he     i demanded     do you know           he   s just a man named gatsby           where is he from  i mean  and what does he do           now you   re started on the subject     she answered with a wan smile      well  he told me once he was an oxford man        a dim background started to take shape behind him  but at her next  remark it faded away        however  i don   t believe it           why not           i don   t know     she insisted     i just don   t think he went there        something in her tone reminded me of the other girl   s    i think he  killed a man     and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity  i would  have accepted without question the information that gatsby sprang from  the swamps of louisiana or from the lower east side of new york  that  was comprehensible  but young men didn   t   at least in my provincial  inexperience i believed they didn   t   drift coolly out of nowhere and  buy a palace on long island sound        anyhow  he gives large parties     said jordan  changing the subject  with an urban distaste for the concrete     and i like large parties   they   re so intimate  at small parties there isn   t any privacy        there was the boom of a bass drum  and the voice of the orchestra  leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden        ladies and gentlemen     he cried     at the request of mr  gatsby we are  going to play for you mr  vladmir tostoff   s latest work  which  attracted so much attention at carnegie hall last may  if you read the  papers you know there was a big sensation     he smiled with jovial  condescension  and added     some sensation     whereupon everybody  laughed        the piece is known     he concluded lustily     as   vladmir tostoff   s  jazz history of the world             the nature of mr  tostoff   s composition eluded me  because just as it  began my eyes fell on gatsby  standing alone on the marble steps and  looking from one group to another with approving eyes  his tanned skin  was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as  though it were trimmed every day  i could see nothing sinister about  him  i wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him  off from his guests  for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as  the fraternal hilarity increased  when the    jazz history of the world     was over  girls were putting their heads on men   s shoulders in a  puppyish  convivial way  girls were swooning backward playfully into  men   s arms  even into groups  knowing that someone would arrest their  falls   but no one swooned backward on gatsby  and no french bob touched  gatsby   s shoulder  and no singing quartets were formed with gatsby   s  head for one link        i beg your pardon        gatsby   s butler was suddenly standing beside us        miss baker     he inquired     i beg your pardon  but mr  gatsby would  like to speak to you alone           with me     she exclaimed in surprise        yes  madame        she got up slowly  raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment  and  followed the butler toward the house  i noticed that she wore her  evening dress  all her dresses  like sports clothes   there was a  jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk  upon golf courses on clean  crisp mornings     i was alone and it was almost two  for some time confused and  intriguing sounds had issued from a long  many windowed room which  overhung the terrace  eluding jordan   s undergraduate  who was now  engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls  and who  implored me to join him  i went inside     the large room was full of people  one of the girls in yellow was  playing the piano  and beside her stood a tall  red haired young lady  from a famous chorus  engaged in song  she had drunk a quantity of  champagne  and during the course of her song she had decided  ineptly   that everything was very  very sad   she was not only singing  she was  weeping too  whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with  gasping  broken sobs  and then took up the lyric again in a quavering  soprano  the tears coursed down her cheeks   not freely  however  for  when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they  assumed an inky colour  and pursued the rest of their way in slow  black rivulets  a humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes  on her face  whereupon she threw up her hands  sank into a chair  and  went off into a deep vinous sleep        she had a fight with a man who says he   s her husband     explained a  girl at my elbow     i looked around  most of the remaining women were now having fights  with men said to be their husbands  even jordan   s party  the quartet  from east egg  were rent asunder by dissension  one of the men was  talking with curious intensity to a young actress  and his wife  after  attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent  way  broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks   at intervals  she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond  and hissed      you promised     into his ear     the reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men  the hall  was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly  indignant wives  the wives were sympathizing with each other in  slightly raised voices        whenever he sees i   m having a good time he wants to go home           never heard anything so selfish in my life           we   re always the first ones to leave           so are we           well  we   re almost the last tonight     said one of the men sheepishly      the orchestra left half an hour ago        in spite of the wives    agreement that such malevolence was beyond  credibility  the dispute ended in a short struggle  and both wives  were lifted  kicking  into the night     as i waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and  jordan baker and gatsby came out together  he was saying some last  word to her  but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into  formality as several people approached him to say goodbye     jordan   s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch  but she  lingered for a moment to shake hands        i   ve just heard the most amazing thing     she whispered     how long  were we in there           why  about an hour           it was   ¦ simply amazing     she repeated abstractedly     but i swore i  wouldn   t tell it and here i am tantalizing you     she yawned gracefully  in my face     please come and see me   ¦ phone book   ¦ under the name of  mrs  sigourney howard   ¦ my aunt   ¦    she was hurrying off as she  talked   her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her  party at the door     rather ashamed that on my first appearance i had stayed so late  i  joined the last of gatsby   s guests  who were clustered around him  i  wanted to explain that i   d hunted for him early in the evening and to  apologize for not having known him in the garden        don   t mention it     he enjoined me eagerly     don   t give it another  thought  old sport     the familiar expression held no more familiarity  than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder     and don   t  forget we   re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning  at nine  o   clock        then the butler  behind his shoulder        philadelphia wants you on the phone  sir           all right  in a minute  tell them i   ll be right there   ¦ good night           good night           good night     he smiled   and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant  significance in having been among the last to go  as if he had desired  it all the time     good night  old sport   ¦ good night        but as i walked down the steps i saw that the evening was not quite  over  fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a  bizarre and tumultuous scene  in the ditch beside the road  right side  up  but violently shorn of one wheel  rested a new coupã© which had  left gatsby   s drive not two minutes before  the sharp jut of a wall  accounted for the detachment of the wheel  which was now getting  considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs  however   as they had left their cars blocking the road  a harsh  discordant din  from those in the rear had been audible for some time  and added to  the already violent confusion of the scene     a man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in  the middle of the road  looking from the car to the tyre and from the  tyre to the observers in a pleasant  puzzled way        see     he explained     it went in the ditch        the fact was infinitely astonishing to him  and i recognized first the  unusual quality of wonder  and then the man   it was the late patron of  gatsby   s library        how   d it happen        he shrugged his shoulders        i know nothing whatever about mechanics     he said decisively        but how did it happen  did you run into the wall           don   t ask me     said owl eyes  washing his hands of the whole  matter     i know very little about driving   next to nothing  it  happened  and that   s all i know           well  if you   re a poor driver you oughtn   t to try driving at night           but i wasn   t even trying     he explained indignantly     i wasn   t even  trying        an awed hush fell upon the bystanders        do you want to commit suicide           you   re lucky it was just a wheel  a bad driver and not even trying           you don   t understand     explained the criminal     i wasn   t driving   there   s another man in the car        the shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained     ah h h     as the door of the coupã© swung slowly open  the crowd   it was  now a crowd   stepped back involuntarily  and when the door had opened  wide there was a ghostly pause  then  very gradually  part by part  a  pale  dangling individual stepped out of the wreck  pawing tentatively  at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe     blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant  groaning of the horns  the apparition stood swaying for a moment  before he perceived the man in the duster        wha   s matter     he inquired calmly     did we run outa gas           look        half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel   he stared at it  for a moment  and then looked upward as though he suspected that it  had dropped from the sky        it came off     someone explained     he nodded        at first i din    notice we   d stopped        a pause  then  taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders   he remarked in a determined voice        wonder   ff tell me where there   s a gas   line station        at least a dozen men  some of them a little better off than he was   explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any  physical bond        back out     he suggested after a moment     put her in reverse           but the wheel   s off        he hesitated        no harm in trying     he said     the caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and i turned away and  cut across the lawn toward home  i glanced back once  a wafer of a  moon was shining over gatsby   s house  making the night fine as before   and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden   a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great  doors  endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host  who  stood on the porch  his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell                                                                                 reading over what i have written so far  i see i have given the  impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were  all that absorbed me  on the contrary  they were merely casual events  in a crowded summer  and  until much later  they absorbed me  infinitely less than my personal affairs     most of the time i worked  in the early morning the sun threw my  shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york  to the probity trust  i knew the other clerks and young bond salesmen  by their first names  and lunched with them in dark  crowded  restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee  i  even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and  worked in the accounting department  but her brother began throwing  mean looks in my direction  so when she went on her vacation in july i  let it blow quietly away     i took dinner usually at the yale club   for some reason it was the  gloomiest event of my day   and then i went upstairs to the library and  studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour  there  were generally a few rioters around  but they never came into the  library  so it was a good place to work  after that  if the night was  mellow  i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel   and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station     i began to like new york  the racy  adventurous feel of it at night   and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and  machines gives to the restless eye  i liked to walk up fifth avenue  and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few  minutes i was going to enter into their lives  and no one would ever  know or disapprove  sometimes  in my mind  i followed them to their  apartments on the corners of hidden streets  and they turned and  smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm  darkness  at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting  loneliness sometimes  and felt it in others   poor young clerks who  loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary  restaurant dinner   young clerks in the dusk  wasting the most poignant  moments of night and life     again at eight o   clock  when the dark lanes of the forties were lined  five deep with throbbing taxicabs  bound for the theatre district  i  felt a sinking in my heart  forms leaned together in the taxis as they  waited  and voices sang  and there was laughter from unheard jokes   and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside  imagining  that i  too  was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate  excitement  i wished them well     for a while i lost sight of jordan baker  and then in midsummer i  found her again  at first i was flattered to go places with her   because she was a golf champion  and everyone knew her name  then it  was something more  i wasn   t actually in love  but i felt a sort of  tender curiosity  the bored haughty face that she turned to the world  concealed something   most affectations conceal something eventually   even though they don   t in the beginning   and one day i found what it  was  when we were on a house party together up in warwick  she left a  borrowed car out in the rain with the top down  and then lied about  it   and suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me  that night at daisy   s  at her first big golf tournament there was a  row that nearly reached the newspapers   a suggestion that she had moved  her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round  the thing approached  the proportions of a scandal   then died away  a caddy retracted his  statement  and the only other witness admitted that he might have been  mistaken  the incident and the name had remained together in my mind     jordan baker instinctively avoided clever  shrewd men  and now i saw  that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence  from a code would be thought impossible  she was incurably dishonest   she wasn   t able to endure being at a disadvantage and  given this  unwillingness  i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she  was very young in order to keep that cool  insolent smile turned to  the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard  jaunty body     it made no difference to me  dishonesty in a woman is a thing you  never blame deeply   i was casually sorry  and then i forgot  it was on  that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving  a car  it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our  fender flicked a button on one man   s coat        you   re a rotten driver     i protested     either you ought to be more  careful  or you oughtn   t to drive at all           i am careful           no  you   re not           well  other people are     she said lightly        what   s that got to do with it           they   ll keep out of my way     she insisted     it takes two to make an  accident           suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself           i hope i never will     she answered     i hate careless people  that   s  why i like you        her grey  sun strained eyes stared straight ahead  but she had  deliberately shifted our relations  and for a moment i thought i loved  her  but i am slow thinking and full of interior rules that act as  brakes on my desires  and i knew that first i had to get myself  definitely out of that tangle back home  i   d been writing letters once  a week and signing them     love  nick     and all i could think of was  how  when that certain girl played tennis  a faint moustache of  perspiration appeared on her upper lip  nevertheless there was a vague  understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before i was free     everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues  and  this is mine  i am one of the few honest people that i have ever  known                                         iv    on sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore   the world and its mistress returned to gatsby   s house and twinkled  hilariously on his lawn        he   s a bootlegger     said the young ladies  moving somewhere between  his cocktails and his flowers     one time he killed a man who had found  out that he was nephew to von hindenburg and second cousin to the  devil  reach me a rose  honey  and pour me a last drop into that there  crystal glass        once i wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of  those who came to gatsby   s house that summer  it is an old timetable  now  disintegrating at its folds  and headed    this schedule in effect  july 5th  1922     but i can still read the grey names  and they will  give you a better impression than my generalities of those who  accepted gatsby   s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of  knowing nothing whatever about him     from east egg  then  came the chester beckers and the leeches  and a  man named bunsen  whom i knew at yale  and doctor webster civet  who  was drowned last summer up in maine  and the hornbeams and the willie  voltaires  and a whole clan named blackbuck  who always gathered in a  corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came  near  and the ismays and the chrysties  or rather hubert auerbach and  mr  chrystie   s wife   and edgar beaver  whose hair  they say  turned  cotton white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all     clarence endive was from east egg  as i remember  he came only once   in white knickerbockers  and had a fight with a bum named etty in the  garden  from farther out on the island came the cheadles and the o   r  p  schraeders  and the stonewall jackson abrams of georgia  and the  fishguards and the ripley snells  snell was there three days before he  went to the penitentiary  so drunk out on the gravel drive that  mrs  ulysses swett   s automobile ran over his right hand  the dancies  came  too  and s  b  whitebait  who was well over sixty  and maurice  a  flink  and the hammerheads  and beluga the tobacco importer  and  beluga   s girls     from west egg came the poles and the mulreadys and cecil roebuck and  cecil schoen and gulick the state senator and newton orchid  who  controlled films par excellence  and eckhaust and clyde cohen and don  s  schwartz  the son  and arthur mccarty  all connected with the  movies in one way or another  and the catlips and the bembergs and g   earl muldoon  brother to that muldoon who afterward strangled his  wife  da fontano the promoter came there  and ed legros and james b       rot gut     ferret and the de jongs and ernest lilly   they came to  gamble  and when ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was  cleaned out and associated traction would have to fluctuate profitably  next day     a man named klipspringer was there so often that he became known as     the boarder      i doubt if he had any other home  of theatrical people  there were gus waize and horace o   donavan and lester myer and george  duckweed and francis bull  also from new york were the chromes and the  backhyssons and the dennickers and russel betty and the corrigans and  the kellehers and the dewars and the scullys and s  w  belcher and the  smirkes and the young quinns  divorced now  and henry l  palmetto  who  killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in times square     benny mcclenahan arrived always with four girls  they were never quite  the same ones in physical person  but they were so identical one with  another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before  i have  forgotten their names   jaqueline  i think  or else consuela  or gloria  or judy or june  and their last names were either the melodious names  of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great american  capitalists whose cousins  if pressed  they would confess themselves  to be     in addition to all these i can remember that faustina o   brien came  there at least once and the baedeker girls and young brewer  who had  his nose shot off in the war  and mr  albrucksburger and miss haag   his fiancã©e  and ardita fitz peters and mr  p  jewett  once head of  the american legion  and miss claudia hip  with a man reputed to be  her chauffeur  and a prince of something  whom we called duke  and  whose name  if i ever knew it  i have forgotten     all these people came to gatsby   s house in the summer                                                                                 at nine o   clock  one morning late in july  gatsby   s gorgeous car  lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody  from its three noted horn     it was the first time he had called on me  though i had gone to two of  his parties  mounted in his hydroplane  and  at his urgent invitation   made frequent use of his beach        good morning  old sport  you   re having lunch with me today and i  thought we   d ride up together        he was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that  resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly american   that comes   i suppose  with the absence of lifting work in youth and  even more   with the formless grace of our nervous  sporadic games  this quality  was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape  of restlessness  he was never quite still  there was always a tapping  foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand     he saw me looking with admiration at his car        it   s pretty  isn   t it  old sport     he jumped off to give me a better  view     haven   t you ever seen it before        i   d seen it  everybody had seen it  it was a rich cream colour  bright  with nickel  swollen here and there in its monstrous length with  triumphant hatboxes and supper boxes and toolboxes  and terraced with  a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns  sitting down  behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory   we started to town     i had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and  found  to my disappointment  that he had little to say  so my first  impression  that he was a person of some undefined consequence  had  gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an  elaborate roadhouse next door     and then came that disconcerting ride  we hadn   t reached west egg  village before gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished  and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel coloured  suit        look here  old sport     he broke out surprisingly     what   s your  opinion of me  anyhow        a little overwhelmed  i began the generalized evasions which that  question deserves        well  i   m going to tell you something about my life     he interrupted      i don   t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you  hear        so he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation  in his halls        i   ll tell you god   s truth     his right hand suddenly ordered divine  retribution to stand by     i am the son of some wealthy people in the  middle west   all dead now  i was brought up in america but educated at  oxford  because all my ancestors have been educated there for many  years  it is a family tradition        he looked at me sideways   and i knew why jordan baker had believed he  was lying  he hurried the phrase    educated at oxford     or swallowed  it  or choked on it  as though it had bothered him before  and with  this doubt  his whole statement fell to pieces  and i wondered if  there wasn   t something a little sinister about him  after all        what part of the middle west     i inquired casually        san francisco           i see           my family all died and i came into a good deal of money        his voice was solemn  as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a  clan still haunted him  for a moment i suspected that he was pulling  my leg  but a glance at him convinced me otherwise        after that i lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of  europe   paris  venice  rome   collecting jewels  chiefly rubies  hunting  big game  painting a little  things for myself only  and trying to  forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago        with an effort i managed to restrain my incredulous laughter  the very  phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that  of a turbaned    character    leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued  a tiger through the bois de boulogne        then came the war  old sport  it was a great relief  and i tried very  hard to die  but i seemed to bear an enchanted life  i accepted a  commission as first lieutenant when it began  in the argonne forest i  took the remains of my machine gun battalion so far forward that there  was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn   t  advance  we stayed there two days and two nights  a hundred and thirty  men with sixteen lewis guns  and when the infantry came up at last  they found the insignia of three german divisions among the piles of  dead  i was promoted to be a major  and every allied government gave  me a decoration   even montenegro  little montenegro down on the  adriatic sea        little montenegro  he lifted up the words and nodded at them   with his  smile  the smile comprehended montenegro   s troubled history and  sympathized with the brave struggles of the montenegrin people  it  appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had  elicited this tribute from montenegro   s warm little heart  my  incredulity was submerged in fascination now  it was like skimming  hastily through a dozen magazines     he reached in his pocket  and a piece of metal  slung on a ribbon   fell into my palm        that   s the one from montenegro        to my astonishment  the thing had an authentic look     orderi di  danilo     ran the circular legend     montenegro  nicolas rex           turn it           major jay gatsby     i read     for valour extraordinary           here   s another thing i always carry  a souvenir of oxford days  it  was taken in trinity quad   the man on my left is now the earl of  doncaster        it was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an  archway through which were visible a host of spires  there was gatsby   looking a little  not much  younger   with a cricket bat in his hand     then it was all true  i saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace  on the grand canal  i saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease  with  their crimson lighted depths  the gnawings of his broken heart        i   m going to make a big request of you today     he said  pocketing his  souvenirs with satisfaction     so i thought you ought to know something  about me  i didn   t want you to think i was just some nobody  you see   i usually find myself among strangers because i drift here and there  trying to forget the sad things that happened to me     he hesitated      you   ll hear about it this afternoon           at lunch           no  this afternoon  i happened to find out that you   re taking miss  baker to tea           do you mean you   re in love with miss baker           no  old sport  i   m not  but miss baker has kindly consented to speak  to you about this matter        i hadn   t the faintest idea what    this matter    was  but i was more  annoyed than interested  i hadn   t asked jordan to tea in order to  discuss mr  jay gatsby  i was sure the request would be something  utterly fantastic  and for a moment i was sorry i   d ever set foot upon  his overpopulated lawn     he wouldn   t say another word  his correctness grew on him as we neared  the city  we passed port roosevelt  where there was a glimpse of  red belted oceangoing ships  and sped along a cobbled slum lined with  the dark  undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen hundreds   then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us  and i had a  glimpse of mrs  wilson straining at the garage pump with panting  vitality as we went by     with fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half  astoria   only half  for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated  i heard the familiar    jug jug spat     of a motorcycle  and a frantic  policeman rode alongside        all right  old sport     called gatsby  we slowed down  taking a white  card from his wallet  he waved it before the man   s eyes        right you are     agreed the policeman  tipping his cap     know you next  time  mr  gatsby  excuse me           what was that     i inquired     the picture of oxford           i was able to do the commissioner a favour once  and he sends me a  christmas card every year        over the great bridge  with the sunlight through the girders making a  constant flicker upon the moving cars  with the city rising up across  the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of  nonolfactory money  the city seen from the queensboro bridge is always  the city seen for the first time  in its first wild promise of all the  mystery and the beauty in the world     a dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms  followed by two  carriages with drawn blinds  and by more cheerful carriages for  friends  the friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short  upper lips of southeastern europe  and i was glad that the sight of  gatsby   s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday  as we  crossed blackwell   s island a limousine passed us  driven by a white  chauffeur  in which sat three modish negroes  two bucks and a girl  i  laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in  haughty rivalry        anything can happen now that we   ve slid over this bridge     i thought      anything at all   ¦       even gatsby could happen  without any particular wonder                                                                                 roaring noon  in a well fanned forty second street cellar i met gatsby  for lunch  blinking away the brightness of the street outside  my eyes  picked him out obscurely in the anteroom  talking to another man        mr  carraway  this is my friend mr  wolfshiem        a small  flat nosed jew raised his large head and regarded me with two  fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril  after a  moment i discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness           so i took one look at him     said mr  wolfshiem  shaking my hand  earnestly     and what do you think i did           what     i inquired politely     but evidently he was not addressing me  for he dropped my hand and  covered gatsby with his expressive nose        i handed the money to katspaugh and i said    all right  katspaugh   don   t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth     he shut it then and  there        gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the  restaurant  whereupon mr  wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was  starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction        highballs     asked the head waiter        this is a nice restaurant here     said mr  wolfshiem  looking at the  presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling     but i like across the street  better           yes  highballs     agreed gatsby  and then to mr  wolfshiem     it   s too  hot over there           hot and small   yes     said mr  wolfshiem     but full of memories           what place is that     i asked        the old metropole           the old metropole     brooded mr  wolfshiem gloomily     filled with  faces dead and gone  filled with friends gone now forever  i can   t  forget so long as i live the night they shot rosy rosenthal there  it  was six of us at the table  and rosy had eat and drunk a lot all  evening  when it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a  funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside    all  right     says rosy  and begins to get up  and i pulled him down in his  chair            let the bastards come in here if they want you  rosy  but don   t  you  so help me  move outside this room           it was four o   clock in the morning then  and if we   d of raised the  blinds we   d of seen daylight           did he go     i asked innocently        sure he went     mr  wolfshiem   s nose flashed at me indignantly     he  turned around in the door and says    don   t let that waiter take away  my coffee     then he went out on the sidewalk  and they shot him three  times in his full belly and drove away           four of them were electrocuted     i said  remembering        five  with becker     his nostrils turned to me in an interested way      i understand you   re looking for a business gonnegtion        the juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling  gatsby answered  for me        oh  no     he exclaimed     this isn   t the man           no     mr  wolfshiem seemed disappointed        this is just a friend  i told you we   d talk about that some other  time           i beg your pardon     said mr  wolfshiem     i had a wrong man        a succulent hash arrived  and mr  wolfshiem  forgetting the more  sentimental atmosphere of the old metropole  began to eat with  ferocious delicacy  his eyes  meanwhile  roved very slowly all around  the room   he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people  directly behind  i think that  except for my presence  he would have  taken one short glance beneath our own table        look here  old sport     said gatsby  leaning toward me     i   m afraid i  made you a little angry this morning in the car        there was the smile again  but this time i held out against it        i don   t like mysteries     i answered     and i don   t understand why you  won   t come out frankly and tell me what you want  why has it all got  to come through miss baker           oh  it   s nothing underhand     he assured me     miss baker   s a great  sportswoman  you know  and she   d never do anything that wasn   t all  right        suddenly he looked at his watch  jumped up  and hurried from the room   leaving me with mr  wolfshiem at the table        he has to telephone     said mr  wolfshiem  following him with his  eyes     fine fellow  isn   t he  handsome to look at and a perfect  gentleman           yes           he   s an oggsford man           oh           he went to oggsford college in england  you know oggsford college           i   ve heard of it           it   s one of the most famous colleges in the world           have you known gatsby for a long time     i inquired        several years     he answered in a gratified way     i made the pleasure  of his acquaintance just after the war  but i knew i had discovered a  man of fine breeding after i talked with him an hour  i said to  myself    there   s the kind of man you   d like to take home and introduce  to your mother and sister          he paused     i see you   re looking at my  cuff buttons        i hadn   t been looking at them  but i did now  they were composed of  oddly familiar pieces of ivory        finest specimens of human molars     he informed me        well     i inspected them     that   s a very interesting idea           yeah     he flipped his sleeves up under his coat     yeah  gatsby   s very  careful about women  he would never so much as look at a friend   s  wife        when the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and  sat down mr  wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his  feet        i have enjoyed my lunch     he said     and i   m going to run off from you  two young men before i outstay my welcome           don   t hurry meyer     said gatsby  without enthusiasm  mr  wolfshiem  raised his hand in a sort of benediction        you   re very polite  but i belong to another generation     he announced  solemnly     you sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies  and your       he supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his  hand     as for me  i am fifty years old  and i won   t impose myself on  you any longer        as he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling  i  wondered if i had said anything to offend him        he becomes very sentimental sometimes     explained gatsby     this is  one of his sentimental days  he   s quite a character around new york   a  denizen of broadway           who is he  anyhow  an actor           no           a dentist           meyer wolfshiem  no  he   s a gambler     gatsby hesitated  then added   coolly     he   s the man who fixed the world   s series back in 1919           fixed the world   s series     i repeated     the idea staggered me  i remembered  of course  that the world   s  series had been fixed in 1919  but if i had thought of it at all i  would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened  the end of  some inevitable chain  it never occurred to me that one man could  start to play with the faith of fifty million people   with the  single mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe        how did he happen to do that     i asked after a minute        he just saw the opportunity           why isn   t he in jail           they can   t get him  old sport  he   s a smart man        i insisted on paying the check  as the waiter brought my change i  caught sight of tom buchanan across the crowded room        come along with me for a minute     i said     i   ve got to say hello to  someone        when he saw us tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our  direction        where   ve you been     he demanded eagerly     daisy   s furious because you  haven   t called up           this is mr  gatsby  mr  buchanan        they shook hands briefly  and a strained  unfamiliar look of  embarrassment came over gatsby   s face        how   ve you been  anyhow     demanded tom of me     how   d you happen to  come up this far to eat           i   ve been having lunch with mr  gatsby        i turned toward mr  gatsby  but he was no longer there                                                                                 one october day in nineteen seventeen        said jordan baker that afternoon  sitting up very straight on a  straight chair in the tea garden at the plaza hotel        i was walking along from one place to another  half on the sidewalks  and half on the lawns  i was happier on the lawns because i had on  shoes from england with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the  soft ground  i had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the  wind  and whenever this happened the red  white  and blue banners in  front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut tut tut tut   in a disapproving way     the largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to  daisy fay   s house  she was just eighteen  two years older than me  and  by far the most popular of all the young girls in louisville  she  dressed in white  and had a little white roadster  and all day long  the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from camp  taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that  night     anyways  for an hour        when i came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was  beside the kerb  and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant i had  never seen before  they were so engrossed in each other that she  didn   t see me until i was five feet away        hello  jordan     she called unexpectedly     please come here        i was flattered that she wanted to speak to me  because of all the  older girls i admired her most  she asked me if i was going to the red  cross to make bandages  i was  well  then  would i tell them that she  couldn   t come that day  the officer looked at daisy while she was  speaking  in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at  sometime  and because it seemed romantic to me i have remembered the  incident ever since  his name was jay gatsby  and i didn   t lay eyes on  him again for over four years   even after i   d met him on long island i  didn   t realize it was the same man     that was nineteen seventeen  by the next year i had a few beaux  myself  and i began to play in tournaments  so i didn   t see daisy very  often  she went with a slightly older crowd   when she went with anyone  at all  wild rumours were circulating about her   how her mother had  found her packing her bag one winter night to go to new york and say  goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas  she was effectually  prevented  but she wasn   t on speaking terms with her family for  several weeks  after that she didn   t play around with the soldiers any  more  but only with a few flat footed  shortsighted young men in town   who couldn   t get into the army at all     by the next autumn she was gay again  gay as ever  she had a dã©but  after the armistice  and in february she was presumably engaged to a  man from new orleans  in june she married tom buchanan of chicago   with more pomp and circumstance than louisville ever knew before  he  came down with a hundred people in four private cars  and hired a  whole floor of the muhlbach hotel  and the day before the wedding he  gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand  dollars     i was a bridesmaid  i came into her room half an hour before the  bridal dinner  and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the june  night in her flowered dress   and as drunk as a monkey  she had a bottle  of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other             gratulate me     she muttered     never had a drink before  but oh how  i do enjoy it           what   s the matter  daisy        i was scared  i can tell you  i   d never seen a girl like that before        here  dearies     she groped around in a wastebasket she had with her  on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls     take    em downstairs  and give    em back to whoever they belong to  tell    em all daisy   s  change    her mine  say    daisy   s change    her mine             she began to cry   she cried and cried  i rushed out and found her  mother   s maid  and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath   she wouldn   t let go of the letter  she took it into the tub with her  and squeezed it up in a wet ball  and only let me leave it in the  soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow     but she didn   t say another word  we gave her spirits of ammonia and  put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress  and half  an hour later  when we walked out of the room  the pearls were around  her neck and the incident was over  next day at five o   clock she  married tom buchanan without so much as a shiver  and started off on a  three months    trip to the south seas     i saw them in santa barbara when they came back  and i thought i   d  never seen a girl so mad about her husband  if he left the room for a  minute she   d look around uneasily  and say     where   s tom gone     and  wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the  door  she used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the  hour  rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with  unfathomable delight  it was touching to see them together   it made you  laugh in a hushed  fascinated way  that was in august  a week after i  left santa barbara tom ran into a wagon on the ventura road one night   and ripped a front wheel off his car  the girl who was with him got  into the papers  too  because her arm was broken   she was one of the  chambermaids in the santa barbara hotel     the next april daisy had her little girl  and they went to france for  a year  i saw them one spring in cannes  and later in deauville  and  then they came back to chicago to settle down  daisy was popular in  chicago  as you know  they moved with a fast crowd  all of them young  and rich and wild  but she came out with an absolutely perfect  reputation  perhaps because she doesn   t drink  it   s a great advantage  not to drink among hard drinking people  you can hold your tongue and   moreover  you can time any little irregularity of your own so that  everybody else is so blind that they don   t see or care  perhaps daisy  never went in for amour at all   and yet there   s something in that voice  of hers   ¦    well  about six weeks ago  she heard the name gatsby for the first  time in years  it was when i asked you   do you remember    if you knew  gatsby in west egg  after you had gone home she came into my room and  woke me up  and said     what gatsby     and when i described him   i was  half asleep   she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man  she used to know  it wasn   t until then that i connected this gatsby  with the officer in her white car                                                                                 when jordan baker had finished telling all this we had left the plaza  for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through central park   the sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in  the west fifties  and the clear voices of children  already gathered  like crickets on the grass  rose through the hot twilight         i   m the sheik of araby  your love belongs to me  at night when   you   re asleep into your tent i   ll creep             it was a strange coincidence     i said        but it wasn   t a coincidence at all           why not           gatsby bought that house so that daisy would be just across the bay        then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that  june night  he came alive to me  delivered suddenly from the womb of  his purposeless splendour        he wants to know     continued jordan     if you   ll invite daisy to your  house some afternoon and then let him come over        the modesty of the demand shook me  he had waited five years and  bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths   so that  he could    come over    some afternoon to a stranger   s garden        did i have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing           he   s afraid  he   s waited so long  he thought you might be  offended  you see  he   s regular tough underneath it all        something worried me        why didn   t he ask you to arrange a meeting           he wants her to see his house     she explained     and your house is  right next door           oh           i think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties  some  night     went on jordan     but she never did  then he began asking  people casually if they knew her  and i was the first one he found  it  was that night he sent for me at his dance  and you should have heard  the elaborate way he worked up to it  of course  i immediately  suggested a luncheon in new york   and i thought he   d go mad            i don   t want to do anything out of the way     he kept saying    i  want to see her right next door           when i said you were a particular friend of tom   s  he started to  abandon the whole idea  he doesn   t know very much about tom  though he  says he   s read a chicago paper for years just on the chance of  catching a glimpse of daisy   s name        it was dark now  and as we dipped under a little bridge i put my arm  around jordan   s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her  to dinner  suddenly i wasn   t thinking of daisy and gatsby any more   but of this clean  hard  limited person  who dealt in universal  scepticism  and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my  arm  a phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady  excitement     there are only the pursued  the pursuing  the busy  and  the tired           and daisy ought to have something in her life     murmured jordan to  me        does she want to see gatsby           she   s not to know about it  gatsby doesn   t want her to know  you   re  just supposed to invite her to tea        we passed a barrier of dark trees  and then the faã§ade of fifty ninth  street  a block of delicate pale light  beamed down into the park   unlike gatsby and tom buchanan  i had no girl whose disembodied face  floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs  and so i drew up  the girl beside me  tightening my arms  her wan  scornful mouth  smiled  and so i drew her up again closer  this time to my face                                         v    when i came home to west egg that night i was afraid for a moment that  my house was on fire  two o   clock and the whole corner of the  peninsula was blazing with light  which fell unreal on the shrubbery  and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires  turning a  corner  i saw that it was gatsby   s house  lit from tower to cellar     at first i thought it was another party  a wild rout that had resolved  itself into    hide and go seek    or    sardines in the box    with all the  house thrown open to the game  but there wasn   t a sound  only wind in  the trees  which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on  again as if the house had winked into the darkness  as my taxi groaned  away i saw gatsby walking toward me across his lawn        your place looks like the world   s fair     i said        does it     he turned his eyes toward it absently     i have been  glancing into some of the rooms  let   s go to coney island  old  sport  in my car           it   s too late           well  suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool  i haven   t made  use of it all summer           i   ve got to go to bed           all right        he waited  looking at me with suppressed eagerness        i talked with miss baker     i said after a moment     i   m going to call  up daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea           oh  that   s all right     he said carelessly     i don   t want to put you  to any trouble           what day would suit you           what day would suit you     he corrected me quickly     i don   t want to  put you to any trouble  you see           how about the day after tomorrow        he considered for a moment  then  with reluctance     i want to get the  grass cut     he said     we both looked down at the grass   there was a sharp line where my  ragged lawn ended and the darker  well kept expanse of his began  i  suspected that he meant my grass        there   s another little thing     he said uncertainly  and hesitated        would you rather put it off for a few days     i asked        oh  it isn   t about that  at least       he fumbled with a series of  beginnings     why  i thought   why  look here  old sport  you don   t make  much money  do you           not very much        this seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently        i thought you didn   t  if you   ll pardon my   you see  i carry on a  little business on the side  a sort of side line  you understand  and  i thought that if you don   t make very much   you   re selling bonds   aren   t you  old sport           trying to           well  this would interest you  it wouldn   t take up much of your time  and you might pick up a nice bit of money  it happens to be a rather  confidential sort of thing        i realize now that under different circumstances that conversation  might have been one of the crises of my life  but  because the offer  was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered  i had no  choice except to cut him off there        i   ve got my hands full     i said     i   m much obliged but i couldn   t  take on any more work           you wouldn   t have to do any business with wolfshiem     evidently he  thought that i was shying away from the    gonnegtion    mentioned at  lunch  but i assured him he was wrong  he waited a moment longer   hoping i   d begin a conversation  but i was too absorbed to be  responsive  so he went unwillingly home     the evening had made me lightheaded and happy  i think i walked into a  deep sleep as i entered my front door  so i don   t know whether or not  gatsby went to coney island  or for how many hours he    glanced into  rooms    while his house blazed gaudily on  i called up daisy from the  office next morning  and invited her to come to tea        don   t bring tom     i warned her        what           don   t bring tom           who is   tom        she asked innocently     the day agreed upon was pouring rain  at eleven o   clock a man in a  raincoat  dragging a lawn mower  tapped at my front door and said that  mr  gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass  this reminded me that i  had forgotten to tell my finn to come back  so i drove into west egg  village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy  some cups and lemons and flowers     the flowers were unnecessary  for at two o   clock a greenhouse arrived  from gatsby   s  with innumerable receptacles to contain it  an hour  later the front door opened nervously  and gatsby in a white flannel  suit  silver shirt  and gold coloured tie  hurried in  he was pale   and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes        is everything all right     he asked immediately        the grass looks fine  if that   s what you mean           what grass     he inquired blankly     oh  the grass in the yard     he  looked out the window at it  but  judging from his expression  i don   t  believe he saw a thing        looks very good     he remarked vaguely     one of the papers said they  thought the rain would stop about four  i think it was the  journal  have you got everything you need in the shape of   of tea        i took him into the pantry  where he looked a little reproachfully at  the finn  together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the  delicatessen shop        will they do     i asked        of course  of course  they   re fine     and he added hollowly       ¦ old  sport        the rain cooled about half past three to a damp mist  through which  occasional thin drops swam like dew  gatsby looked with vacant eyes  through a copy of clay   s economics  starting at the finnish tread that  shook the kitchen floor  and peering towards the bleared windows from  time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were  taking place outside  finally he got up and informed me  in an  uncertain voice  that he was going home        why   s that           nobody   s coming to tea  it   s too late     he looked at his watch as if  there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere     i can   t wait  all day           don   t be silly  it   s just two minutes to four        he sat down miserably  as if i had pushed him  and simultaneously  there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane  we both jumped  up  and  a little harrowed myself  i went out into the yard     under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the  drive  it stopped  daisy   s face  tipped sideways beneath a  three cornered lavender hat  looked out at me with a bright ecstatic  smile        is this absolutely where you live  my dearest one        the exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain  i  had to follow the sound of it for a moment  up and down  with my ear  alone  before any words came through  a damp streak of hair lay like a  dash of blue paint across her cheek  and her hand was wet with  glistening drops as i took it to help her from the car        are you in love with me     she said low in my ear     or why did i have  to come alone           that   s the secret of castle rackrent  tell your chauffeur to go far  away and spend an hour           come back in an hour  ferdie     then in a grave murmur     his name is  ferdie           does the gasoline affect his nose           i don   t think so     she said innocently     why        we went in  to my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted        well  that   s funny     i exclaimed        what   s funny        she turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the  front door  i went out and opened it  gatsby  pale as death  with his  hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets  was standing in a  puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes     with his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the  hall  turned sharply as if he were on a wire  and disappeared into the  living room  it wasn   t a bit funny  aware of the loud beating of my  own heart i pulled the door to against the increasing rain     for half a minute there wasn   t a sound  then from the living room i  heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh  followed by  daisy   s voice on a clear artificial note        i certainly am awfully glad to see you again        a pause  it endured horribly  i had nothing to do in the hall  so i  went into the room     gatsby  his hands still in his pockets  was reclining against the  mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease  even of  boredom  his head leaned back so far that it rested against the face  of a defunct mantelpiece clock  and from this position his distraught  eyes stared down at daisy  who was sitting  frightened but graceful   on the edge of a stiff chair        we   ve met before     muttered gatsby  his eyes glanced momentarily at  me  and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh  luckily  the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his  head  whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers  and  set it back in place  then he sat down  rigidly  his elbow on the arm  of the sofa and his chin in his hand        i   m sorry about the clock     he said     my own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn  i couldn   t muster up  a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head        it   s an old clock     i told them idiotically     i think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on  the floor        we haven   t met for many years     said daisy  her voice as  matter of fact as it could ever be        five years next november        the automatic quality of gatsby   s answer set us all back at least  another minute  i had them both on their feet with the desperate  suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac  finn brought it in on a tray     amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical  decency established itself  gatsby got himself into a shadow and   while daisy and i talked  looked conscientiously from one to the other  of us with tense  unhappy eyes  however  as calmness wasn   t an end in  itself  i made an excuse at the first possible moment  and got to my  feet        where are you going     demanded gatsby in immediate alarm        i   ll be back           i   ve got to speak to you about something before you go        he followed me wildly into the kitchen  closed the door  and  whispered     oh  god     in a miserable way        what   s the matter           this is a terrible mistake     he said  shaking his head from side to  side     a terrible  terrible mistake           you   re just embarrassed  that   s all     and luckily i added     daisy   s  embarrassed too           she   s embarrassed     he repeated incredulously        just as much as you are           don   t talk so loud           you   re acting like a little boy     i broke out impatiently     not only  that  but you   re rude  daisy   s sitting in there all alone        he raised his hand to stop my words  looked at me with unforgettable  reproach  and  opening the door cautiously  went back into the other  room     i walked out the back way   just as gatsby had when he had made his  nervous circuit of the house half an hour before   and ran for a huge  black knotted tree  whose massed leaves made a fabric against the  rain  once more it was pouring  and my irregular lawn  well shaved by  gatsby   s gardener  abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric  marshes  there was nothing to look at from under the tree except  gatsby   s enormous house  so i stared at it  like kant at his church  steeple  for half an hour  a brewer had built it early in the    period     craze  a decade before  and there was a story that he   d agreed to pay  five years    taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would  have their roofs thatched with straw  perhaps their refusal took the  heart out of his plan to found a family   he went into an immediate  decline  his children sold his house with the black wreath still on  the door  americans  while willing  even eager  to be serfs  have  always been obstinate about being peasantry     after half an hour  the sun shone again  and the grocer   s automobile  rounded gatsby   s drive with the raw material for his servants     dinner   i felt sure he wouldn   t eat a spoonful  a maid began opening  the upper windows of his house  appeared momentarily in each  and   leaning from the large central bay  spat meditatively into the  garden  it was time i went back  while the rain continued it had  seemed like the murmur of their voices  rising and swelling a little  now and then with gusts of emotion  but in the new silence i felt that  silence had fallen within the house too     i went in   after making every possible noise in the kitchen  short of  pushing over the stove   but i don   t believe they heard a sound  they  were sitting at either end of the couch  looking at each other as if  some question had been asked  or was in the air  and every vestige of  embarrassment was gone  daisy   s face was smeared with tears  and when  i came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief  before a mirror  but there was a change in gatsby that was simply  confounding  he literally glowed  without a word or a gesture of  exultation a new well being radiated from him and filled the little  room        oh  hello  old sport     he said  as if he hadn   t seen me for years  i  thought for a moment he was going to shake hands        it   s stopped raining           has it     when he realized what i was talking about  that there were  twinkle bells of sunshine in the room  he smiled like a weather man   like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light  and repeated the news to  daisy     what do you think of that  it   s stopped raining           i   m glad  jay     her throat  full of aching  grieving beauty  told  only of her unexpected joy        i want you and daisy to come over to my house     he said     i   d like to  show her around           you   re sure you want me to come           absolutely  old sport        daisy went upstairs to wash her face   too late i thought with  humiliation of my towels   while gatsby and i waited on the lawn        my house looks well  doesn   t it     he demanded     see how the whole  front of it catches the light        i agreed that it was splendid        yes     his eyes went over it  every arched door and square tower     it  took me just three years to earn the money that bought it           i thought you inherited your money           i did  old sport     he said automatically     but i lost most of it in  the big panic   the panic of the war        i think he hardly knew what he was saying  for when i asked him what  business he was in he answered     that   s my affair     before he realized  that it wasn   t an appropriate reply        oh  i   ve been in several things     he corrected himself     i was in the  drug business and then i was in the oil business  but i   m not in  either one now     he looked at me with more attention     do you mean  you   ve been thinking over what i proposed the other night        before i could answer  daisy came out of the house and two rows of  brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight        that huge place there     she cried pointing        do you like it           i love it  but i don   t see how you live there all alone           i keep it always full of interesting people  night and day  people  who do interesting things  celebrated people        instead of taking the shortcut along the sound we went down to the  road and entered by the big postern  with enchanting murmurs daisy  admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky   admired the gardens  the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy  odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of  kiss me at the gate  it was strange to reach the marble steps and find  no stir of bright dresses in and out the door  and hear no sound but  bird voices in the trees     and inside  as we wandered through marie antoinette music rooms and  restoration salons  i felt that there were guests concealed behind  every couch and table  under orders to be breathlessly silent until we  had passed through  as gatsby closed the door of    the merton college  library    i could have sworn i heard the owl eyed man break into  ghostly laughter     we went upstairs  through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender  silk and vivid with new flowers  through dressing rooms and poolrooms   and bathrooms with sunken baths   intruding into one chamber where a  dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor  it  was mr  klipspringer  the    boarder     i had seen him wandering hungrily  about the beach that morning  finally we came to gatsby   s own  apartment  a bedroom and a bath  and an adam   s study  where we sat  down and drank a glass of some chartreuse he took from a cupboard in  the wall     he hadn   t once ceased looking at daisy  and i think he revalued  everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew  from her well loved eyes  sometimes too  he stared around at his  possessions in a dazed way  as though in her actual and astounding  presence none of it was any longer real  once he nearly toppled down a  flight of stairs     his bedroom was the simplest room of all   except where the dresser was  garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold  daisy took the brush  with delight  and smoothed her hair  whereupon gatsby sat down and  shaded his eyes and began to laugh        it   s the funniest thing  old sport     he said hilariously     i  can   t   when i try to          he had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a  third  after his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed  with wonder at her presence  he had been full of the idea so long   dreamed it right through to the end  waited with his teeth set  so to  speak  at an inconceivable pitch of intensity  now  in the reaction   he was running down like an over wound clock     recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent  cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing gowns and ties  and  his shirts  piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high        i   ve got a man in england who buys me clothes  he sends over a  selection of things at the beginning of each season  spring and fall        he took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them  one by one   before us  shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel   which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in  many coloured disarray  while we admired he brought more and the soft  rich heap mounted higher   shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in  coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange  with monograms of  indian blue  suddenly  with a strained sound  daisy bent her head into  the shirts and began to cry stormily        they   re such beautiful shirts     she sobbed  her voice muffled in the  thick folds     it makes me sad because i   ve never seen such   such  beautiful shirts before                                                                                    after the house  we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool  and  the hydroplane  and the midsummer flowers   but outside gatsby   s window  it began to rain again  so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated  surface of the sound        if it wasn   t for the mist we could see your home across the bay      said gatsby     you always have a green light that burns all night at  the end of your dock        daisy put her arm through his abruptly  but he seemed absorbed in what  he had just said  possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal  significance of that light had now vanished forever  compared to the  great distance that had separated him from daisy it had seemed very  near to her  almost touching her  it had seemed as close as a star to  the moon  now it was again a green light on a dock  his count of  enchanted objects had diminished by one     i began to walk about the room  examining various indefinite objects  in the half darkness  a large photograph of an elderly man in yachting  costume attracted me  hung on the wall over his desk        who   s this           that  that   s mr  dan cody  old sport        the name sounded faintly familiar        he   s dead now  he used to be my best friend years ago        there was a small picture of gatsby  also in yachting costume  on the  bureau   gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly   taken apparently  when he was about eighteen        i adore it     exclaimed daisy     the pompadour  you never told me you  had a pompadour   or a yacht           look at this     said gatsby quickly     here   s a lot of clippings   about  you        they stood side by side examining it  i was going to ask to see the  rubies when the phone rang  and gatsby took up the receiver        yes   ¦ well  i can   t talk now   ¦ i can   t talk now  old sport   ¦ i said a  small town   ¦ he must know what a small town is   ¦ well  he   s no use to  us if detroit is his idea of a small town   ¦       he rang off        come here quick     cried daisy at the window     the rain was still falling  but the darkness had parted in the west   and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea        look at that     she whispered  and then after a moment     i   d like to  just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you  around        i tried to go then  but they wouldn   t hear of it  perhaps my presence  made them feel more satisfactorily alone        i know what we   ll do     said gatsby     we   ll have klipspringer play the  piano        he went out of the room calling    ewing     and returned in a few minutes  accompanied by an embarrassed  slightly worn young man  with  shell rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair  he was now decently  clothed in a    sport shirt     open at the neck  sneakers  and duck  trousers of a nebulous hue        did we interrupt your exercise     inquired daisy politely        i was asleep     cried mr  klipspringer  in a spasm of embarrassment      that is  i   d been asleep  then i got up   ¦          klipspringer plays the piano     said gatsby  cutting him off     don   t  you  ewing  old sport           i don   t play well  i don   t   hardly play at all  i   m all out of prac             we   ll go downstairs     interrupted gatsby  he flipped a switch  the  grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light     in the music room gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano   he lit daisy   s cigarette from a trembling match  and sat down with her  on a couch far across the room  where there was no light save what the  gleaming floor bounced in from the hall     when klipspringer had played    the love nest    he turned around on the  bench and searched unhappily for gatsby in the gloom        i   m all out of practice  you see  i told you i couldn   t play  i   m all  out of prac             don   t talk so much  old sport     commanded gatsby     play            in the morning  in the evening  ain   t we got fun          outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along  the sound  all the lights were going on in west egg now  the electric  trains  men carrying  were plunging home through the rain from new  york  it was the hour of a profound human change  and excitement was  generating on the air         one thing   s sure and nothing   s surer the rich get richer and the   poor get   children  in the meantime  in between time          as i went over to say goodbye i saw that the expression of  bewilderment had come back into gatsby   s face  as though a faint doubt  had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness  almost  five years  there must have been moments even that afternoon when  daisy tumbled short of his dreams   not through her own fault  but  because of the colossal vitality of his illusion  it had gone beyond  her  beyond everything  he had thrown himself into it with a creative  passion  adding to it all the time  decking it out with every bright  feather that drifted his way  no amount of fire or freshness can  challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart     as i watched him he adjusted himself a little  visibly  his hand took  hold of hers  and as she said something low in his ear he turned  toward her with a rush of emotion  i think that voice held him most   with its fluctuating  feverish warmth  because it couldn   t be  over dreamed   that voice was a deathless song     they had forgotten me  but daisy glanced up and held out her hand   gatsby didn   t know me now at all  i looked once more at them and they  looked back at me  remotely  possessed by intense life  then i went  out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain  leaving them  there together                                         vi    about this time an ambitious young reporter from new york arrived one  morning at gatsby   s door and asked him if he had anything to say        anything to say about what     inquired gatsby politely        why   any statement to give out        it transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard  gatsby   s name around his office in a connection which he either  wouldn   t reveal or didn   t fully understand  this was his day off and  with laudable initiative he had hurried out    to see        it was a random shot  and yet the reporter   s instinct was right   gatsby   s notoriety  spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his  hospitality and so become authorities upon his past  had increased all  summer until he fell just short of being news  contemporary legends  such as the    underground pipeline to canada    attached themselves to  him  and there was one persistent story that he didn   t live in a house  at all  but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly  up and down the long island shore  just why these inventions were a  source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota  isn   t easy to  say     james gatz   that was really  or at least legally  his name  he had  changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that  witnessed the beginning of his career   when he saw dan cody   s yacht  drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake superior  it was  james gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a  torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants  but it was already jay  gatsby who borrowed a rowboat  pulled out to the tuolomee  and  informed cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an  hour     i suppose he   d had the name ready for a long time  even then  his  parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people   his imagination  had never really accepted them as his parents at all  the truth was  that jay gatsby of west egg  long island  sprang from his platonic  conception of himself  he was a son of god   a phrase which  if it means  anything  means just that   and he must be about his father   s business   the service of a vast  vulgar  and meretricious beauty  so he invented  just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeen year old boy would be  likely to invent  and to this conception he was faithful to the end     for over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of  lake superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other  capacity that brought him food and bed  his brown  hardening body  lived naturally through the half fierce  half lazy work of the bracing  days  he knew women early  and since they spoiled him he became  contemptuous of them  of young virgins because they were ignorant  of  the others because they were hysterical about things which in his  overwhelming self absorption he took for granted     but his heart was in a constant  turbulent riot  the most grotesque  and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night  a universe of  ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock  ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled  clothes upon the floor  each night he added to the pattern of his  fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an  oblivious embrace  for a while these reveries provided an outlet for  his imagination  they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of  reality  a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on  a fairy   s wing     an instinct toward his future glory had led him  some months before   to the small lutheran college of st  olaf   s in southern minnesota  he  stayed there two weeks  dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the  drums of his destiny  to destiny itself  and despising the janitor   s  work with which he was to pay his way through  then he drifted back to  lake superior  and he was still searching for something to do on the  day that dan cody   s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore     cody was fifty years old then  a product of the nevada silver fields   of the yukon  of every rush for metal since seventy five  the  transactions in montana copper that made him many times a millionaire  found him physically robust but on the verge of soft mindedness  and   suspecting this  an infinite number of women tried to separate him  from his money  the none too savoury ramifications by which ella kaye   the newspaper woman  played madame de maintenon to his weakness and  sent him to sea in a yacht  were common property of the turgid  journalism in 1902  he had been coasting along all too hospitable  shores for five years when he turned up as james gatz   s destiny in  little girl bay     to young gatz  resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck   that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world  i  suppose he smiled at cody   he had probably discovered that people liked  him when he smiled  at any rate cody asked him a few questions  one of  them elicited the brand new name  and found that he was quick and  extravagantly ambitious  a few days later he took him to duluth and  bought him a blue coat  six pairs of white duck trousers  and a  yachting cap  and when the tuolomee left for the west indies and the  barbary coast  gatsby left too     he was employed in a vague personal capacity   while he remained with  cody he was in turn steward  mate  skipper  secretary  and even  jailor  for dan cody sober knew what lavish doings dan cody drunk  might soon be about  and he provided for such contingencies by  reposing more and more trust in gatsby  the arrangement lasted five  years  during which the boat went three times around the continent   it might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that ella kaye  came on board one night in boston and a week later dan cody  inhospitably died     i remember the portrait of him up in gatsby   s bedroom  a grey  florid  man with a hard  empty face   the pioneer debauchee  who during one  phase of american life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage  violence of the frontier brothel and saloon  it was indirectly due to  cody that gatsby drank so little  sometimes in the course of gay  parties women used to rub champagne into his hair  for himself he  formed the habit of letting liquor alone     and it was from cody that he inherited money   a legacy of twenty five  thousand dollars  he didn   t get it  he never understood the legal  device that was used against him  but what remained of the millions  went intact to ella kaye  he was left with his singularly appropriate  education  the vague contour of jay gatsby had filled out to the  substantiality of a man                                                                                 he told me all this very much later  but i   ve put it down here with  the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents   which weren   t even faintly true  moreover he told it to me at a time  of confusion  when i had reached the point of believing everything and  nothing about him  so i take advantage of this short halt  while  gatsby  so to speak  caught his breath  to clear this set of  misconceptions away     it was a halt  too  in my association with his affairs  for several  weeks i didn   t see him or hear his voice on the phone   mostly i was in  new york  trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself  with her senile aunt   but finally i went over to his house one sunday  afternoon  i hadn   t been there two minutes when somebody brought tom  buchanan in for a drink  i was startled  naturally  but the really  surprising thing was that it hadn   t happened before     they were a party of three on horseback   tom and a man named sloane and  a pretty woman in a brown riding habit  who had been there previously        i   m delighted to see you     said gatsby  standing on his porch     i   m  delighted that you dropped in        as though they cared        sit right down  have a cigarette or a cigar     he walked around the  room quickly  ringing bells     i   ll have something to drink for you in  just a minute        he was profoundly affected by the fact that tom was there  but he  would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something  realizing in  a vague way that that was all they came for  mr  sloane wanted  nothing  a lemonade  no  thanks  a little champagne  nothing at all   thanks   ¦ i   m sorry          did you have a nice ride           very good roads around here           i suppose the automobiles             yeah        moved by an irresistible impulse  gatsby turned to tom  who had  accepted the introduction as a stranger        i believe we   ve met somewhere before  mr  buchanan           oh  yes     said tom  gruffly polite  but obviously not remembering      so we did  i remember very well           about two weeks ago           that   s right  you were with nick here           i know your wife     continued gatsby  almost aggressively        that so        tom turned to me        you live near here  nick           next door           that so        mr  sloane didn   t enter into the conversation  but lounged back  haughtily in his chair  the woman said nothing either   until  unexpectedly  after two highballs  she became cordial        we   ll all come over to your next party  mr  gatsby     she suggested      what do you say           certainly  i   d be delighted to have you           be ver    nice     said mr  sloane  without gratitude     well   think ought  to be starting home           please don   t hurry     gatsby urged them  he had control of himself  now  and he wanted to see more of tom     why don   t you   why don   t you  stay for supper  i wouldn   t be surprised if some other people dropped  in from new york           you come to supper with me     said the lady enthusiastically     both of  you        this included me  mr  sloane got to his feet        come along     he said   but to her only        i mean it     she insisted     i   d love to have you  lots of room        gatsby looked at me questioningly  he wanted to go and he didn   t see  that mr  sloane had determined he shouldn   t        i   m afraid i won   t be able to     i said        well  you come     she urged  concentrating on gatsby     mr  sloane murmured something close to her ear        we won   t be late if we start now     she insisted aloud        i haven   t got a horse     said gatsby     i used to ride in the army  but  i   ve never bought a horse  i   ll have to follow you in my car  excuse  me for just a minute        the rest of us walked out on the porch  where sloane and the lady  began an impassioned conversation aside        my god  i believe the man   s coming     said tom     doesn   t he know she  doesn   t want him           she says she does want him           she has a big dinner party and he won   t know a soul there     he  frowned     i wonder where in the devil he met daisy  by god  i may be  old fashioned in my ideas  but women run around too much these days to  suit me  they meet all kinds of crazy fish        suddenly mr  sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted  their horses        come on     said mr  sloane to tom     we   re late  we   ve got to go      and  then to me     tell him we couldn   t wait  will you        tom and i shook hands  the rest of us exchanged a cool nod  and they  trotted quickly down the drive  disappearing under the august foliage  just as gatsby  with hat and light overcoat in hand  came out the  front door     tom was evidently perturbed at daisy   s running around alone  for on  the following saturday night he came with her to gatsby   s  party  perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of  oppressiveness   it stands out in my memory from gatsby   s other parties  that summer  there were the same people  or at least the same sort of  people  the same profusion of champagne  the same many coloured   many keyed commotion  but i felt an unpleasantness in the air  a  pervading harshness that hadn   t been there before  or perhaps i had  merely grown used to it  grown to accept west egg as a world complete  in itself  with its own standards and its own great figures  second to  nothing because it had no consciousness of being so  and now i was  looking at it again  through daisy   s eyes  it is invariably saddening  to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your  own powers of adjustment     they arrived at twilight  and  as we strolled out among the sparkling  hundreds  daisy   s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat        these things excite me so     she whispered     if you want to kiss me  any time during the evening  nick  just let me know and i   ll be glad  to arrange it for you  just mention my name  or present a green card   i   m giving out green             look around     suggested gatsby        i   m looking around  i   m having a marvellous             you must see the faces of many people you   ve heard about        tom   s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd        we don   t go around very much     he said     in fact  i was just thinking  i don   t know a soul here           perhaps you know that lady     gatsby indicated a gorgeous  scarcely  human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree  tom  and daisy stared  with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies  the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies        she   s lovely     said daisy        the man bending over her is her director        he took them ceremoniously from group to group        mrs  buchanan   ¦ and mr  buchanan       after an instant   s hesitation he  added     the polo player           oh no     objected tom quickly     not me        but evidently the sound of it pleased gatsby for tom remained    the  polo player    for the rest of the evening        i   ve never met so many celebrities     daisy exclaimed     i liked that  man   what was his name    with the sort of blue nose        gatsby identified him  adding that he was a small producer        well  i liked him anyhow           i   d a little rather not be the polo player     said tom pleasantly      i   d rather look at all these famous people in   in oblivion        daisy and gatsby danced  i remember being surprised by his graceful   conservative foxtrot   i had never seen him dance before  then they  sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour   while at her request i remained watchfully in the garden     in case  there   s a fire or a flood     she explained     or any act of god        tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper  together     do you mind if i eat with some people over here     he  said     a fellow   s getting off some funny stuff           go ahead     answered daisy genially     and if you want to take down any  addresses here   s my little gold pencil       ¦ she looked around after a  moment and told me the girl was    common but pretty     and i knew that  except for the half hour she   d been alone with gatsby she wasn   t  having a good time     we were at a particularly tipsy table  that was my fault   gatsby had  been called to the phone  and i   d enjoyed these same people only two  weeks before  but what had amused me then turned septic on the air  now        how do you feel  miss baedeker        the girl addressed was trying  unsuccessfully  to slump against my  shoulder  at this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes        wha           a massive and lethargic woman  who had been urging daisy to play golf  with her at the local club tomorrow  spoke in miss baedeker   s defence        oh  she   s all right now  when she   s had five or six cocktails she  always starts screaming like that  i tell her she ought to leave it  alone           i do leave it alone     affirmed the accused hollowly        we heard you yelling  so i said to doc civet here    there   s somebody  that needs your help  doc                she   s much obliged  i   m sure     said another friend  without  gratitude     but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in  the pool           anything i hate is to get my head stuck in a pool     mumbled miss  baedeker     they almost drowned me once over in new jersey           then you ought to leave it alone     countered doctor civet        speak for yourself     cried miss baedeker violently     your hand  shakes  i wouldn   t let you operate on me        it was like that  almost the last thing i remember was standing with  daisy and watching the moving picture director and his star  they were  still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except  for a pale  thin ray of moonlight between  it occurred to me that he  had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this  proximity  and even while i watched i saw him stoop one ultimate  degree and kiss at her cheek        i like her     said daisy     i think she   s lovely        but the rest offended her   and inarguably because it wasn   t a gesture  but an emotion  she was appalled by west egg  this unprecedented     place    that broadway had begotten upon a long island fishing  village   appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old  euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants  along a shortcut from nothing to nothing  she saw something awful in  the very simplicity she failed to understand     i sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car   it was dark here in front  only the bright door sent ten square feet  of light volleying out into the soft black morning  sometimes a shadow  moved against a dressing room blind above  gave way to another shadow   an indefinite procession of shadows  who rouged and powdered in an  invisible glass        who is this gatsby anyhow     demanded tom suddenly     some big  bootlegger           where   d you hear that     i inquired        i didn   t hear it  i imagined it  a lot of these newly rich people are  just big bootleggers  you know           not gatsby     i said shortly     he was silent for a moment  the pebbles of the drive crunched under  his feet        well  he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie  together        a breeze stirred the grey haze of daisy   s fur collar        at least they are more interesting than the people we know     she said  with an effort        you didn   t look so interested           well  i was        tom laughed and turned to me        did you notice daisy   s face when that girl asked her to put her under  a cold shower        daisy began to sing with the music in a husky  rhythmic whisper   bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and  would never have again  when the melody rose her voice broke up  sweetly  following it  in a way contralto voices have  and each change  tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air        lots of people come who haven   t been invited     she said  suddenly     that girl hadn   t been invited  they simply force their way  in and he   s too polite to object           i   d like to know who he is and what he does     insisted tom     and i  think i   ll make a point of finding out           i can tell you right now     she answered     he owned some drugstores  a  lot of drugstores  he built them up himself        the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive        good night  nick     said daisy     her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps  where     three o   clock in the morning     a neat  sad little waltz of that year   was drifting out the open door  after all  in the very casualness of  gatsby   s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from  her world  what was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling  her back inside  what would happen now in the dim  incalculable hours   perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive  a person infinitely rare  and to be marvelled at  some authentically radiant young girl who with  one fresh glance at gatsby  one moment of magical encounter  would  blot out those five years of unwavering devotion     i stayed late that night  gatsby asked me to wait until he was free   and i lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had  run up  chilled and exalted  from the black beach  until the lights  were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead  when he came down the  steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face   and his eyes were bright and tired        she didn   t like it     he said immediately        of course she did           she didn   t like it     he insisted     she didn   t have a good time        he was silent  and i guessed at his unutterable depression        i feel far away from her     he said     it   s hard to make her  understand           you mean about the dance           the dance     he dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of  his fingers     old sport  the dance is unimportant        he wanted nothing less of daisy than that she should go to tom and  say     i never loved you     after she had obliterated four years with  that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be  taken  one of them was that  after she was free  they were to go back  to louisville and be married from her house   just as if it were five  years ago        and she doesn   t understand     he said     she used to be able to  understand  we   d sit for hours          he broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit  rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers        i wouldn   t ask too much of her     i ventured     you can   t repeat the  past           can   t repeat the past     he cried incredulously     why of course you  can        he looked around him wildly  as if the past were lurking here in the  shadow of his house  just out of reach of his hand        i   m going to fix everything just the way it was before     he said   nodding determinedly     she   ll see        he talked a lot about the past  and i gathered that he wanted to  recover something  some idea of himself perhaps  that had gone into  loving daisy  his life had been confused and disordered since then   but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it  all slowly  he could find out what that thing was   ¦      ¦ one autumn night  five years before  they had been walking down the  street when the leaves were falling  and they came to a place where  there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight  they  stopped here and turned toward each other  now it was a cool night  with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes  of the year  the quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the  darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars  out of the  corner of his eye gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really  formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees   he could  climb to it  if he climbed alone  and once there he could suck on the  pap of life  gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder     his heart beat faster as daisy   s white face came up to his own  he  knew that when he kissed this girl  and forever wed his unutterable  visions to her perishable breath  his mind would never romp again like  the mind of god  so he waited  listening for a moment longer to the  tuning fork that had been struck upon a star  then he kissed her  at  his lips    touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the  incarnation was complete     through all he said  even through his appalling sentimentality  i was  reminded of something   an elusive rhythm  a fragment of lost words   that i had heard somewhere a long time ago  for a moment a phrase  tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man   s   as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled  air  but they made no sound  and what i had almost remembered was  uncommunicable forever                                        vii    it was when curiosity about gatsby was at its highest that the lights  in his house failed to go on one saturday night   and  as obscurely as  it had begun  his career as trimalchio was over  only gradually did i  become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his  drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away  wondering  if he were sick i went over to find out   an unfamiliar butler with a  villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door        is mr  gatsby sick           nope     after a pause he added    sir    in a dilatory  grudging way        i hadn   t seen him around  and i was rather worried  tell him mr   carraway came over           who     he demanded rudely        carraway           carraway  all right  i   ll tell him        abruptly he slammed the door     my finn informed me that gatsby had dismissed every servant in his  house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others  who never  went into west egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen  but ordered  moderate supplies over the telephone  the grocery boy reported that  the kitchen looked like a pigsty  and the general opinion in the  village was that the new people weren   t servants at all     next day gatsby called me on the phone        going away     i inquired        no  old sport           i hear you fired all your servants           i wanted somebody who wouldn   t gossip  daisy comes over quite  often   in the afternoons        so the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the  disapproval in her eyes        they   re some people wolfshiem wanted to do something for  they   re all  brothers and sisters  they used to run a small hotel           i see        he was calling up at daisy   s request   would i come to lunch at her  house tomorrow  miss baker would be there  half an hour later daisy  herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that i was  coming  something was up  and yet i couldn   t believe that they would  choose this occasion for a scene   especially for the rather harrowing  scene that gatsby had outlined in the garden     the next day was broiling  almost the last  certainly the warmest  of  the summer  as my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight  only  the hot whistles of the national biscuit company broke the simmering  hush at noon  the straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of  combustion  the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into  her white shirtwaist  and then  as her newspaper dampened under her  fingers  lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry  her  pocketbook slapped to the floor        oh  my     she gasped     i picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her  holding it  at arm   s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that  i had no designs upon it   but everyone near by  including the woman   suspected me just the same        hot     said the conductor to familiar faces     some weather    ¦ hot    ¦  hot    ¦ hot    ¦ is it hot enough for you  is it hot  is it   ¦          my commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand   that anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed   whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart       ¦ through the hall of the buchanans    house blew a faint wind  carrying  the sound of the telephone bell out to gatsby and me as we waited at  the door        the master   s body     roared the butler into the mouthpiece     i   m  sorry  madame  but we can   t furnish it   it   s far too hot to touch this  noon        what he really said was     yes   ¦ yes   ¦ i   ll see        he set down the receiver and came toward us  glistening slightly  to  take our stiff straw hats        madame expects you in the salon     he cried  needlessly indicating the  direction  in this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the  common store of life     the room  shadowed well with awnings  was dark and cool  daisy and  jordan lay upon an enormous couch  like silver idols weighing down  their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans        we can   t move     they said together     jordan   s fingers  powdered white over their tan  rested for a moment  in mine        and mr  thomas buchanan  the athlete     i inquired     simultaneously i heard his voice  gruff  muffled  husky  at the hall  telephone     gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with  fascinated eyes  daisy watched him and laughed  her sweet  exciting  laugh  a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air        the rumour is     whispered jordan     that that   s tom   s girl on the  telephone        we were silent  the voice in the hall rose high with annoyance     very  well  then  i won   t sell you the car at all   ¦ i   m under no obligations  to you at all   ¦ and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time  i  won   t stand that at all           holding down the receiver     said daisy cynically        no  he   s not     i assured her     it   s a bona fide deal  i happen to  know about it        tom flung open the door  blocked out its space for a moment with his  thick body  and hurried into the room        mr  gatsby     he put out his broad  flat hand with well concealed  dislike     i   m glad to see you  sir   ¦ nick   ¦          make us a cold drink     cried daisy     as he left the room again she got up and went over to gatsby and  pulled his face down  kissing him on the mouth        you know i love you     she murmured        you forget there   s a lady present     said jordan     daisy looked around doubtfully        you kiss nick too           what a low  vulgar girl           i don   t care     cried daisy  and began to clog on the brick fireplace   then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just  as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room        bles sed pre cious     she crooned  holding out her arms     come to your  own mother that loves you        the child  relinquished by the nurse  rushed across the room and  rooted shyly into her mother   s dress        the bles sed pre cious  did mother get powder on your old yellowy  hair  stand up now  and say   how de do        gatsby and i in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand   afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise  i don   t think he  had ever really believed in its existence before        i got dressed before luncheon     said the child  turning eagerly to  daisy        that   s because your mother wanted to show you off     her face bent  into the single wrinkle of the small white neck     you dream  you  you  absolute little dream           yes     admitted the child calmly     aunt jordan   s got on a white dress  too           how do you like mother   s friends     daisy turned her around so that  she faced gatsby     do you think they   re pretty           where   s daddy           she doesn   t look like her father     explained daisy     she looks like  me  she   s got my hair and shape of the face        daisy sat back upon the couch  the nurse took a step forward and held  out her hand        come  pammy           goodbye  sweetheart        with a reluctant backward glance the well disciplined child held to  her nurse   s hand and was pulled out the door  just as tom came back   preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice     gatsby took up his drink        they certainly look cool     he said  with visible tension     we drank in long  greedy swallows        i read somewhere that the sun   s getting hotter every year     said tom  genially     it seems that pretty soon the earth   s going to fall into  the sun   or wait a minute   it   s just the opposite   the sun   s getting  colder every year        come outside     he suggested to gatsby     i   d like you to have a look  at the place        i went with them out to the veranda  on the green sound  stagnant in  the heat  one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea   gatsby   s eyes followed it momentarily  he raised his hand and pointed  across the bay        i   m right across from you           so you are        our eyes lifted over the rose beds and the hot lawn and the weedy  refuse of the dog days alongshore  slowly the white wings of the boat  moved against the blue cool limit of the sky  ahead lay the scalloped  ocean and the abounding blessed isles        there   s sport for you     said tom  nodding     i   d like to be out there  with him for about an hour        we had luncheon in the dining room  darkened too against the heat  and  drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale        what   ll we do with ourselves this afternoon     cried daisy     and the  day after that  and the next thirty years           don   t be morbid     jordan said     life starts all over again when it  gets crisp in the fall           but it   s so hot     insisted daisy  on the verge of tears     and  everything   s so confused  let   s all go to town        her voice struggled on through the heat  beating against it  moulding  its senselessness into forms        i   ve heard of making a garage out of a stable     tom was saying to  gatsby     but i   m the first man who ever made a stable out of a  garage           who wants to go to town     demanded daisy insistently  gatsby   s eyes  floated toward her     ah     she cried     you look so cool        their eyes met  and they stared together at each other  alone in  space  with an effort she glanced down at the table        you always look so cool     she repeated     she had told him that she loved him  and tom buchanan saw  he was  astounded  his mouth opened a little  and he looked at gatsby  and  then back at daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew  a long time ago        you resemble the advertisement of the man     she went on innocently      you know the advertisement of the man             all right     broke in tom quickly     i   m perfectly willing to go to  town  come on   we   re all going to town        he got up  his eyes still flashing between gatsby and his wife  no one  moved        come on     his temper cracked a little     what   s the matter  anyhow   if we   re going to town  let   s start        his hand  trembling with his effort at self control  bore to his lips  the last of his glass of ale  daisy   s voice got us to our feet and out  on to the blazing gravel drive        are we just going to go     she objected     like this  aren   t we going  to let anyone smoke a cigarette first           everybody smoked all through lunch           oh  let   s have fun     she begged him     it   s too hot to fuss        he didn   t answer        have it your own way     she said     come on  jordan        they went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there  shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet  a silver curve of the moon  hovered already in the western sky  gatsby started to speak  changed  his mind  but not before tom wheeled and faced him expectantly        have you got your stables here     asked gatsby with an effort        about a quarter of a mile down the road           oh        a pause        i don   t see the idea of going to town     broke out tom savagely      women get these notions in their heads             shall we take anything to drink     called daisy from an upper window        i   ll get some whisky     answered tom  he went inside     gatsby turned to me rigidly        i can   t say anything in his house  old sport           she   s got an indiscreet voice     i remarked     it   s full of       i  hesitated        her voice is full of money     he said suddenly     that was it  i   d never understood before  it was full of money   that  was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it  the jingle of  it  the cymbals    song of it   ¦ high in a white palace the king   s  daughter  the golden girl   ¦    tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel  followed  by daisy and jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and  carrying light capes over their arms        shall we all go in my car     suggested gatsby  he felt the hot  green  leather of the seat     i ought to have left it in the shade           is it standard shift     demanded tom        yes           well  you take my coupã© and let me drive your car to town        the suggestion was distasteful to gatsby        i don   t think there   s much gas     he objected        plenty of gas     said tom boisterously  he looked at the gauge     and  if it runs out i can stop at a drugstore  you can buy anything at a  drugstore nowadays        a pause followed this apparently pointless remark  daisy looked at tom  frowning  and an indefinable expression  at once definitely unfamiliar  and vaguely recognizable  as if i had only heard it described in  words  passed over gatsby   s face        come on  daisy    said tom  pressing her with his hand toward gatsby   s  car     i   ll take you in this circus wagon        he opened the door  but she moved out from the circle of his arm        you take nick and jordan  we   ll follow you in the coupã©        she walked close to gatsby  touching his coat with her hand  jordan  and tom and i got into the front seat of gatsby   s car  tom pushed the  unfamiliar gears tentatively  and we shot off into the oppressive  heat  leaving them out of sight behind        did you see that     demanded tom        see what        he looked at me keenly  realizing that jordan and i must have known  all along        you think i   m pretty dumb  don   t you     he suggested     perhaps i am   but i have a   almost a second sight  sometimes  that tells me what to  do  maybe you don   t believe that  but science          he paused  the immediate contingency overtook him  pulled him back  from the edge of theoretical abyss        i   ve made a small investigation of this fellow     he continued     i  could have gone deeper if i   d known             do you mean you   ve been to a medium     inquired jordan humorously        what     confused  he stared at us as we laughed     a medium           about gatsby           about gatsby  no  i haven   t  i said i   d been making a small  investigation of his past           and you found he was an oxford man     said jordan helpfully        an oxford man     he was incredulous     like hell he is  he wears a pink  suit           nevertheless he   s an oxford man           oxford  new mexico     snorted tom contemptuously     or something like  that           listen  tom  if you   re such a snob  why did you invite him to lunch      demanded jordan crossly        daisy invited him  she knew him before we were married   god knows  where        we were all irritable now with the fading ale  and aware of it we  drove for a while in silence  then as doctor t  j  eckleburg   s faded  eyes came into sight down the road  i remembered gatsby   s caution  about gasoline        we   ve got enough to get us to town     said tom        but there   s a garage right here     objected jordan     i don   t want to  get stalled in this baking heat        tom threw on both brakes impatiently  and we slid to an abrupt dusty  stop under wilson   s sign  after a moment the proprietor emerged from  the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow eyed at the car        let   s have some gas     cried tom roughly     what do you think we  stopped for   to admire the view           i   m sick     said wilson without moving     been sick all day           what   s the matter           i   m all run down           well  shall i help myself     tom demanded     you sounded well enough on  the phone        with an effort wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and   breathing hard  unscrewed the cap of the tank  in the sunlight his  face was green        i didn   t mean to interrupt your lunch     he said     but i need money  pretty bad  and i was wondering what you were going to do with your  old car           how do you like this one     inquired tom     i bought it last week           it   s a nice yellow one     said wilson  as he strained at the handle        like to buy it           big chance     wilson smiled faintly     no  but i could make some money  on the other           what do you want money for  all of a sudden           i   ve been here too long  i want to get away  my wife and i want to go  west           your wife does     exclaimed tom  startled        she   s been talking about it for ten years     he rested for a moment  against the pump  shading his eyes     and now she   s going whether she  wants to or not  i   m going to get her away        the coupã© flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a  waving hand        what do i owe you     demanded tom harshly        i just got wised up to something funny the last two days     remarked  wilson     that   s why i want to get away  that   s why i been bothering  you about the car           what do i owe you           dollar twenty        the relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and i had a  bad moment there before i realized that so far his suspicions hadn   t  alighted on tom  he had discovered that myrtle had some sort of life  apart from him in another world  and the shock had made him physically  sick  i stared at him and then at tom  who had made a parallel  discovery less than an hour before   and it occurred to me that there  was no difference between men  in intelligence or race  so profound as  the difference between the sick and the well  wilson was so sick that  he looked guilty  unforgivably guilty   as if he had just got some poor  girl with child        i   ll let you have that car     said tom     i   ll send it over tomorrow  afternoon        that locality was always vaguely disquieting  even in the broad glare  of afternoon  and now i turned my head as though i had been warned of  something behind  over the ash heaps the giant eyes of doctor t  j   eckleburg kept their vigil  but i perceived  after a moment  that  other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than  twenty feet away     in one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved  aside a little  and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car  so  engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed  and  one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a  slowly developing picture  her expression was curiously familiar   it  was an expression i had often seen on women   s faces  but on myrtle  wilson   s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized  that her eyes  wide with jealous terror  were fixed not on tom  but on  jordan baker  whom she took to be his wife                                                                                 there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind  and as we  drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic  his wife and his  mistress  until an hour ago secure and inviolate  were slipping  precipitately from his control  instinct made him step on the  accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking daisy and leaving  wilson behind  and we sped along toward astoria at fifty miles an  hour  until  among the spidery girders of the elevated  we came in  sight of the easygoing blue coupã©        those big movies around fiftieth street are cool     suggested  jordan     i love new york on summer afternoons when everyone   s away   there   s something very sensuous about it   overripe  as if all sorts of  funny fruits were going to fall into your hands        the word    sensuous    had the effect of further disquieting tom  but  before he could invent a protest the coupã© came to a stop  and daisy  signalled us to draw up alongside        where are we going     she cried        how about the movies           it   s so hot     she complained     you go  we   ll ride around and meet you  after     with an effort her wit rose faintly     we   ll meet you on some  corner  i   ll be the man smoking two cigarettes           we can   t argue about it here     tom said impatiently  as a truck gave  out a cursing whistle behind us     you follow me to the south side of  central park  in front of the plaza        several times he turned his head and looked back for their car  and if  the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight  i  think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his  life forever     but they didn   t  and we all took the less explicable step of engaging  the parlour of a suite in the plaza hotel     the prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into  that room eludes me  though i have a sharp physical memory that  in  the course of it  my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around  my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back   the notion originated with daisy   s suggestion that we hire five  bathrooms and take cold baths  and then assumed more tangible form as     a place to have a mint julep     each of us said over and over that it  was a    crazy idea      we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and  thought  or pretended to think  that we were being very funny   ¦    the room was large and stifling  and  though it was already four  o   clock  opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery  from the park  daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us   fixing her hair        it   s a swell suite     whispered jordan respectfully  and everyone  laughed        open another window     commanded daisy  without turning around        there aren   t any more           well  we   d better telephone for an axe             the thing to do is to forget about the heat     said tom impatiently      you make it ten times worse by crabbing about it        he unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the  table        why not let her alone  old sport     remarked gatsby     you   re the one  that wanted to come to town        there was a moment of silence  the telephone book slipped from its  nail and splashed to the floor  whereupon jordan whispered     excuse  me      but this time no one laughed        i   ll pick it up     i offered        i   ve got it     gatsby examined the parted string  muttered    hum     in  an interested way  and tossed the book on a chair        that   s a great expression of yours  isn   t it     said tom sharply        what is           all this   old sport    business  where   d you pick that up           now see here  tom     said daisy  turning around from the mirror     if  you   re going to make personal remarks i won   t stay here a minute   call up and order some ice for the mint julep        as tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound  and we were listening to the portentous chords of mendelssohn   s  wedding march from the ballroom below        imagine marrying anybody in this heat     cried jordan dismally        still   i was married in the middle of june     daisy remembered      louisville in june  somebody fainted  who was it fainted  tom           biloxi     he answered shortly        a man named biloxi    blocks    biloxi  and he made boxes   that   s a  fact   and he was from biloxi  tennessee           they carried him into my house     appended jordan     because we lived  just two doors from the church  and he stayed three weeks  until daddy  told him he had to get out  the day after he left daddy died      after  a moment she added     there wasn   t any connection           i used to know a bill biloxi from memphis     i remarked        that was his cousin  i knew his whole family history before he  left  he gave me an aluminium putter that i use today        the music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer  floated in at the window  followed by intermittent cries of     yea   ea   ea     and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began        we   re getting old     said daisy     if we were young we   d rise and  dance           remember biloxi     jordan warned her     where   d you know him  tom           biloxi     he concentrated with an effort     i didn   t know him  he was a  friend of daisy   s           he was not     she denied     i   d never seen him before  he came down in  the private car           well  he said he knew you  he said he was raised in louisville  asa  bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room  for him        jordan smiled        he was probably bumming his way home  he told me he was president of  your class at yale        tom and i looked at each other blankly        biloxi           first place  we didn   t have any president          gatsby   s foot beat a short  restless tattoo and tom eyed him suddenly        by the way  mr  gatsby  i understand you   re an oxford man           not exactly           oh  yes  i understand you went to oxford           yes   i went there        a pause  then tom   s voice  incredulous and insulting        you must have gone there about the time biloxi went to new haven        another pause  a waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice  but the silence was unbroken by his    thank you    and the soft closing  of the door  this tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last        i told you i went there     said gatsby        i heard you  but i   d like to know when           it was in nineteen nineteen  i only stayed five months  that   s why i  can   t really call myself an oxford man        tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief  but we were all  looking at gatsby        it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the  armistice     he continued     we could go to any of the universities in  england or france        i wanted to get up and slap him on the back  i had one of those  renewals of complete faith in him that i   d experienced before     daisy rose  smiling faintly  and went to the table        open the whisky  tom     she ordered     and i   ll make you a mint julep   then you won   t seem so stupid to yourself   ¦ look at the mint           wait a minute     snapped tom     i want to ask mr  gatsby one more  question           go on     gatsby said politely        what kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow        they were out in the open at last and gatsby was content        he isn   t causing a row     daisy looked desperately from one to the  other     you   re causing a row  please have a little self control           self control     repeated tom incredulously     i suppose the latest  thing is to sit back and let mr  nobody from nowhere make love to your  wife  well  if that   s the idea you can count me out   ¦ nowadays people  begin by sneering at family life and family institutions  and next  they   ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between  black and white        flushed with his impassioned gibberish  he saw himself standing alone  on the last barrier of civilization        we   re all white here     murmured jordan        i know i   m not very popular  i don   t give big parties  i suppose  you   ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any  friends   in the modern world        angry as i was  as we all were  i was tempted to laugh whenever he  opened his mouth  the transition from libertine to prig was so  complete        i   ve got something to tell you  old sport       began gatsby  but daisy  guessed at his intention        please don   t     she interrupted helplessly     please let   s all go  home  why don   t we all go home           that   s a good idea     i got up     come on  tom  nobody wants a drink           i want to know what mr  gatsby has to tell me           your wife doesn   t love you     said gatsby     she   s never loved you   she loves me           you must be crazy     exclaimed tom automatically     gatsby sprang to his feet  vivid with excitement        she never loved you  do you hear     he cried     she only married you  because i was poor and she was tired of waiting for me  it was a  terrible mistake  but in her heart she never loved anyone except me        at this point jordan and i tried to go  but tom and gatsby insisted  with competitive firmness that we remain   as though neither of them had  anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously  of their emotions        sit down  daisy     tom   s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal  note     what   s been going on  i want to hear all about it           i told you what   s been going on     said gatsby     going on for five  years   and you didn   t know        tom turned to daisy sharply        you   ve been seeing this fellow for five years           not seeing     said gatsby     no  we couldn   t meet  but both of us loved  each other all that time  old sport  and you didn   t know  i used to  laugh sometimes      but there was no laughter in his eyes      to think that  you didn   t know           oh   that   s all     tom tapped his thick fingers together like a  clergyman and leaned back in his chair        you   re crazy     he exploded     i can   t speak about what happened five  years ago  because i didn   t know daisy then   and i   ll be damned if i  see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries  to the back door  but all the rest of that   s a god damned lie  daisy  loved me when she married me and she loves me now           no     said gatsby  shaking his head        she does  though  the trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish  ideas in her head and doesn   t know what she   s doing     he nodded  sagely     and what   s more  i love daisy too  once in a while i go off  on a spree and make a fool of myself  but i always come back  and in  my heart i love her all the time           you   re revolting     said daisy  she turned to me  and her voice   dropping an octave lower  filled the room with thrilling scorn     do  you know why we left chicago  i   m surprised that they didn   t treat you  to the story of that little spree        gatsby walked over and stood beside her        daisy  that   s all over now     he said earnestly     it doesn   t matter  any more  just tell him the truth   that you never loved him   and it   s  all wiped out forever        she looked at him blindly     why   how could i love him   possibly           you never loved him        she hesitated  her eyes fell on jordan and me with a sort of appeal   as though she realized at last what she was doing   and as though she  had never  all along  intended doing anything at all  but it was done  now  it was too late        i never loved him     she said  with perceptible reluctance        not at kapiolani     demanded tom suddenly        no        from the ballroom beneath  muffled and suffocating chords were  drifting up on hot waves of air        not that day i carried you down from the punch bowl to keep your  shoes dry     there was a husky tenderness in his tone   ¦    daisy           please don   t     her voice was cold  but the rancour was gone from it   she looked at gatsby     there  jay     she said   but her hand as she tried  to light a cigarette was trembling  suddenly she threw the cigarette  and the burning match on the carpet        oh  you want too much     she cried to gatsby     i love you now   isn   t  that enough  i can   t help what   s past     she began to sob  helplessly     i did love him once   but i loved you too        gatsby   s eyes opened and closed        you loved me too     he repeated        even that   s a lie     said tom savagely     she didn   t know you were  alive  why   there   s things between daisy and me that you   ll never know   things that neither of us can ever forget        the words seemed to bite physically into gatsby        i want to speak to daisy alone     he insisted     she   s all excited  now             even alone i can   t say i never loved tom     she admitted in a pitiful  voice     it wouldn   t be true           of course it wouldn   t     agreed tom     she turned to her husband        as if it mattered to you     she said        of course it matters  i   m going to take better care of you from now  on           you don   t understand     said gatsby  with a touch of panic     you   re  not going to take care of her any more           i   m not     tom opened his eyes wide and laughed  he could afford to  control himself now     why   s that           daisy   s leaving you           nonsense           i am  though     she said with a visible effort        she   s not leaving me     tom   s words suddenly leaned down over gatsby      certainly not for a common swindler who   d have to steal the ring he  put on her finger           i won   t stand this     cried daisy     oh  please let   s get out           who are you  anyhow     broke out tom     you   re one of that bunch that  hangs around with meyer wolfshiem   that much i happen to know  i   ve  made a little investigation into your affairs   and i   ll carry it  further tomorrow           you can suit yourself about that  old sport     said gatsby steadily        i found out what your   drugstores    were     he turned to us and spoke  rapidly     he and this wolfshiem bought up a lot of side street  drugstores here and in chicago and sold grain alcohol over the  counter  that   s one of his little stunts  i picked him for a  bootlegger the first time i saw him  and i wasn   t far wrong           what about it     said gatsby politely     i guess your friend walter  chase wasn   t too proud to come in on it           and you left him in the lurch  didn   t you  you let him go to jail for  a month over in new jersey  god  you ought to hear walter on the  subject of you           he came to us dead broke  he was very glad to pick up some money  old  sport           don   t you call me   old sport        cried tom  gatsby said  nothing     walter could have you up on the betting laws too  but  wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth        that unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in gatsby   s face        that drugstore business was just small change     continued tom slowly      but you   ve got something on now that walter   s afraid to tell me  about        i glanced at daisy  who was staring terrified between gatsby and her  husband  and at jordan  who had begun to balance an invisible but  absorbing object on the tip of her chin  then i turned back to  gatsby   and was startled at his expression  he looked   and this is said  in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden   as if he had     killed a man     for a moment the set of his face could be described in  just that fantastic way     it passed  and he began to talk excitedly to daisy  denying  everything  defending his name against accusations that had not been  made  but with every word she was drawing further and further into  herself  so he gave that up  and only the dead dream fought on as the  afternoon slipped away  trying to touch what was no longer tangible   struggling unhappily  undespairingly  toward that lost voice across  the room     the voice begged again to go        please  tom  i can   t stand this any more        her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions  whatever courage  she had had  were definitely gone        you two start on home  daisy     said tom     in mr  gatsby   s car        she looked at tom  alarmed now  but he insisted with magnanimous  scorn        go on  he won   t annoy you  i think he realizes that his presumptuous  little flirtation is over        they were gone  without a word  snapped out  made accidental   isolated  like ghosts  even from our pity     after a moment tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of  whisky in the towel        want any of this stuff  jordan    ¦ nick        i didn   t answer        nick     he asked again        what           want any           no   ¦ i just remembered that today   s my birthday        i was thirty  before me stretched the portentous  menacing road of a  new decade     it was seven o   clock when we got into the coupã© with him and started  for long island  tom talked incessantly  exulting and laughing  but  his voice was as remote from jordan and me as the foreign clamour on  the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead  human sympathy  has its limits  and we were content to let all their tragic arguments  fade with the city lights behind  thirty   the promise of a decade of  loneliness  a thinning list of single men to know  a thinning  briefcase of enthusiasm  thinning hair  but there was jordan beside  me  who  unlike daisy  was too wise ever to carry well forgotten  dreams from age to age  as we passed over the dark bridge her wan face  fell lazily against my coat   s shoulder and the formidable stroke of  thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand     so we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight                                                                                 the young greek  michaelis  who ran the coffee joint beside the  ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest  he had slept  through the heat until after five  when he strolled over to the  garage  and found george wilson sick in his office   really sick  pale  as his own pale hair and shaking all over  michaelis advised him to go  to bed  but wilson refused  saying that he   d miss a lot of business if  he did  while his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent  racket broke out overhead        i   ve got my wife locked in up there     explained wilson calmly      she   s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow  and then we   re  going to move away        michaelis was astonished  they had been neighbours for four years  and  wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement   generally he was one of these worn out men  when he wasn   t working  he  sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars  that passed along the road  when anyone spoke to him he invariably  laughed in an agreeable  colourless way  he was his wife   s man and not  his own     so naturally michaelis tried to find out what had happened  but wilson  wouldn   t say a word   instead he began to throw curious  suspicious  glances at his visitor and ask him what he   d been doing at certain  times on certain days  just as the latter was getting uneasy  some  workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant  and michaelis  took the opportunity to get away  intending to come back later  but he  didn   t  he supposed he forgot to  that   s all  when he came outside  again  a little after seven  he was reminded of the conversation  because he heard mrs  wilson   s voice  loud and scolding  downstairs in  the garage        beat me     he heard her cry     throw me down and beat me  you dirty  little coward        a moment later she rushed out into the dusk  waving her hands and  shouting   before he could move from his door the business was over     the    death car    as the newspapers called it  didn   t stop  it came out  of the gathering darkness  wavered tragically for a moment  and then  disappeared around the next bend  mavro michaelis wasn   t even sure of  its colour   he told the first policeman that it was light green  the  other car  the one going toward new york  came to rest a hundred yards  beyond  and its driver hurried back to where myrtle wilson  her life  violently extinguished  knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark  blood with the dust     michaelis and this man reached her first  but when they had torn open  her shirtwaist  still damp with perspiration  they saw that her left  breast was swinging loose like a flap  and there was no need to listen  for the heart beneath  the mouth was wide open and ripped a little at  the corners  as though she had choked a little in giving up the  tremendous vitality she had stored so long                                                                                 we saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still  some distance away        wreck     said tom     that   s good  wilson   ll have a little business at  last        he slowed down  but still without any intention of stopping  until  as  we came nearer  the hushed  intent faces of the people at the garage  door made him automatically put on the brakes        we   ll take a look     he said doubtfully     just a look        i became aware now of a hollow  wailing sound which issued incessantly  from the garage  a sound which as we got out of the coupã© and walked  toward the door resolved itself into the words    oh  my god     uttered  over and over in a gasping moan        there   s some bad trouble here     said tom excitedly     he reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the  garage  which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal  basket overhead  then he made a harsh sound in his throat  and with a  violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way  through     the circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation  it  was a minute before i could see anything at all  then new arrivals  deranged the line  and jordan and i were pushed suddenly inside     myrtle wilson   s body  wrapped in a blanket  and then in another  blanket  as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night  lay on  a worktable by the wall  and tom  with his back to us  was bending  over it  motionless  next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking  down names with much sweat and correction in a little book  at first i  couldn   t find the source of the high  groaning words that echoed  clamorously through the bare garage   then i saw wilson standing on the  raised threshold of his office  swaying back and forth and holding to  the doorposts with both hands  some man was talking to him in a low  voice and attempting  from time to time  to lay a hand on his  shoulder  but wilson neither heard nor saw  his eyes would drop slowly  from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall  and then jerk  back to the light again  and he gave out incessantly his high   horrible call        oh  my ga od  oh  my ga od  oh  ga od  oh  my ga od        presently tom lifted his head with a jerk and  after staring around  the garage with glazed eyes  addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to  the policeman        m a v       the policeman was saying        o             no  r       corrected the man     m a v r o             listen to me     muttered tom fiercely        r       said the policeman     o             g             g       he looked up as tom   s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder      what you want  fella           what happened    that   s what i want to know           auto hit her  ins   antly killed           instantly killed     repeated tom  staring        she ran out ina road  son of a bitch didn   t even stopus car           there was two cars     said michaelis     one comin     one goin     see           going where     asked the policeman keenly        one goin    each way  well  she      his hand rose toward the blankets but  stopped halfway and fell to his side      she ran out there an    the one  comin    from n   york knock right into her  goin    thirty or forty miles  an hour           what   s the name of this place here     demanded the officer        hasn   t got any name        a pale well dressed negro stepped near        it was a yellow car     he said     big yellow car  new           see the accident     asked the policeman        no  but the car passed me down the road  going faster   n forty  going  fifty  sixty           come here and let   s have your name  look out now  i want to get his  name        some words of this conversation must have reached wilson  swaying in  the office door  for suddenly a new theme found voice among his  grasping cries        you don   t have to tell me what kind of car it was  i know what kind  of car it was        watching tom  i saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten  under his coat  he walked quickly over to wilson and  standing in  front of him  seized him firmly by the upper arms        you   ve got to pull yourself together     he said with soothing  gruffness     wilson   s eyes fell upon tom  he started up on his tiptoes and then  would have collapsed to his knees had not tom held him upright        listen     said tom  shaking him a little     i just got here a minute  ago  from new york  i was bringing you that coupã© we   ve been talking  about  that yellow car i was driving this afternoon wasn   t mine   do you  hear  i haven   t seen it all afternoon        only the negro and i were near enough to hear what he said  but the  policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent  eyes        what   s all that     he demanded        i   m a friend of his     tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on  wilson   s body     he says he knows the car that did it   ¦ it was a yellow  car        some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at tom        and what colour   s your car           it   s a blue car  a coupã©           we   ve come straight from new york     i said     someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this  and  the policeman turned away        now  if you   ll let me have that name again correct          picking up wilson like a doll  tom carried him into the office  set  him down in a chair  and came back        if somebody   ll come here and sit with him     he snapped  authoritatively  he watched while the two men standing closest glanced  at each other and went unwillingly into the room  then tom shut the  door on them and came down the single step  his eyes avoiding the  table  as he passed close to me he whispered     let   s get out        self consciously  with his authoritative arms breaking the way  we  pushed through the still gathering crowd  passing a hurried doctor   case in hand  who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago     tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend   then his foot came down  hard  and the coupã© raced along through the night  in a little while i  heard a low husky sob  and saw that the tears were overflowing down  his face        the god damned coward     he whimpered     he didn   t even stop his car                                                                                    the buchanans    house floated suddenly toward us through the dark  rustling trees  tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the  second floor  where two windows bloomed with light among the vines        daisy   s home     he said  as we got out of the car he glanced at me and  frowned slightly        i ought to have dropped you in west egg  nick  there   s nothing we can  do tonight        a change had come over him  and he spoke gravely  and with decision   as we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of  the situation in a few brisk phrases        i   ll telephone for a taxi to take you home  and while you   re waiting  you and jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some  supper   if you want any     he opened the door     come in           no  thanks  but i   d be glad if you   d order me the taxi  i   ll wait  outside        jordan put her hand on my arm        won   t you come in  nick           no  thanks        i was feeling a little sick and i wanted to be alone  but jordan  lingered for a moment more        it   s only half past nine     she said     i   d be damned if i   d go in  i   d had enough of all of them for one day   and suddenly that included jordan too  she must have seen something of  this in my expression  for she turned abruptly away and ran up the  porch steps into the house  i sat down for a few minutes with my head  in my hands  until i heard the phone taken up inside and the butler   s  voice calling a taxi  then i walked slowly down the drive away from  the house  intending to wait by the gate     i hadn   t gone twenty yards when i heard my name and gatsby stepped  from between two bushes into the path  i must have felt pretty weird  by that time  because i could think of nothing except the luminosity  of his pink suit under the moon        what are you doing     i inquired        just standing here  old sport        somehow  that seemed a despicable occupation  for all i knew he was  going to rob the house in a moment  i wouldn   t have been surprised to  see sinister faces  the faces of    wolfshiem   s people     behind him in  the dark shrubbery        did you see any trouble on the road     he asked after a minute        yes        he hesitated        was she killed           yes           i thought so  i told daisy i thought so  it   s better that the shock  should all come at once  she stood it pretty well        he spoke as if daisy   s reaction was the only thing that mattered        i got to west egg by a side road     he went on     and left the car in  my garage  i don   t think anybody saw us  but of course i can   t be  sure        i disliked him so much by this time that i didn   t find it necessary to  tell him he was wrong        who was the woman     he inquired        her name was wilson  her husband owns the garage  how the devil did  it happen           well  i tried to swing the wheel       he broke off  and suddenly i  guessed at the truth        was daisy driving           yes     he said after a moment     but of course i   ll say i was  you see   when we left new york she was very nervous and she thought it would  steady her to drive   and this woman rushed out at us just as we were  passing a car coming the other way  it all happened in a minute  but  it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us  thought we were  somebody she knew  well  first daisy turned away from the woman toward  the other car  and then she lost her nerve and turned back  the second  my hand reached the wheel i felt the shock   it must have killed her  instantly           it ripped her open             don   t tell me  old sport     he winced     anyhow   daisy stepped on it  i  tried to make her stop  but she couldn   t  so i pulled on the emergency  brake  then she fell over into my lap and i drove on        she   ll be all right tomorrow     he said presently     i   m just going to  wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness  this afternoon  she   s locked herself into her room  and if he tries  any brutality she   s going to turn the light out and on again           he won   t touch her     i said     he   s not thinking about her           i don   t trust him  old sport           how long are you going to wait           all night  if necessary  anyhow  till they all go to bed        a new point of view occurred to me  suppose tom found out that daisy  had been driving  he might think he saw a connection in it   he might  think anything  i looked at the house  there were two or three bright  windows downstairs and the pink glow from daisy   s room on the ground  floor        you wait here     i said     i   ll see if there   s any sign of a  commotion        i walked back along the border of the lawn  traversed the gravel  softly  and tiptoed up the veranda steps  the drawing room curtains  were open  and i saw that the room was empty  crossing the porch where  we had dined that june night three months before  i came to a small  rectangle of light which i guessed was the pantry window  the blind  was drawn  but i found a rift at the sill     daisy and tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table   with a plate of cold fried chicken between them  and two bottles of  ale  he was talking intently across the table at her  and in his  earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own  once in a  while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement     they weren   t happy  and neither of them had touched the chicken or the  ale   and yet they weren   t unhappy either  there was an unmistakable air  of natural intimacy about the picture  and anybody would have said  that they were conspiring together     as i tiptoed from the porch i heard my taxi feeling its way along the  dark road toward the house  gatsby was waiting where i had left him in  the drive        is it all quiet up there     he asked anxiously        yes  it   s all quiet     i hesitated     you   d better come home and get  some sleep        he shook his head        i want to wait here till daisy goes to bed  good night  old sport        he put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his  scrutiny of the house  as though my presence marred the sacredness of  the vigil  so i walked away and left him standing there in the  moonlight   watching over nothing                                        viii    i couldn   t sleep all night  a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the  sound  and i tossed half sick between grotesque reality and savage   frightening dreams  toward dawn i heard a taxi go up gatsby   s drive   and immediately i jumped out of bed and began to dress   i felt that i  had something to tell him  something to warn him about  and morning  would be too late     crossing his lawn  i saw that his front door was still open and he was  leaning against a table in the hall  heavy with dejection or sleep        nothing happened     he said wanly     i waited  and about four o   clock  she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned  out the light        his house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when  we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes  we pushed aside  curtains that were like pavilions  and felt over innumerable feet of  dark wall for electric light switches   once i tumbled with a sort of  splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano  there was an inexplicable  amount of dust everywhere  and the rooms were musty  as though they  hadn   t been aired for many days  i found the humidor on an unfamiliar  table  with two stale  dry cigarettes inside  throwing open the french  windows of the drawing room  we sat smoking out into the darkness        you ought to go away     i said     it   s pretty certain they   ll trace  your car           go away now  old sport           go to atlantic city for a week  or up to montreal        he wouldn   t consider it  he couldn   t possibly leave daisy until he  knew what she was going to do  he was clutching at some last hope and  i couldn   t bear to shake him free     it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with  dan cody   told it to me because    jay gatsby    had broken up like glass  against tom   s hard malice  and the long secret extravaganza was played  out  i think that he would have acknowledged anything now  without  reserve  but he wanted to talk about daisy     she was the first    nice    girl he had ever known  in various unrevealed  capacities he had come in contact with such people  but always with  indiscernible barbed wire between  he found her excitingly  desirable  he went to her house  at first with other officers from  camp taylor  then alone  it amazed him   he had never been in such a  beautiful house before  but what gave it an air of breathless  intensity  was that daisy lived there   it was as casual a thing to her  as his tent out at camp was to him  there was a ripe mystery about it   a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other  bedrooms  of gay and radiant activities taking place through its  corridors  and of romances that were not musty and laid away already  in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year   s  shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely  withered  it excited him  too  that many men had already loved  daisy   it increased her value in his eyes  he felt their presence all  about the house  pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still  vibrant emotions     but he knew that he was in daisy   s house by a colossal  accident  however glorious might be his future as jay gatsby  he was  at present a penniless young man without a past  and at any moment the  invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders  so he  made the most of his time  he took what he could get  ravenously and  unscrupulously   eventually he took daisy one still october night  took  her because he had no real right to touch her hand     he might have despised himself  for he had certainly taken her under  false pretences  i don   t mean that he had traded on his phantom  millions  but he had deliberately given daisy a sense of security  he  let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as  herself   that he was fully able to take care of her  as a matter of  fact  he had no such facilities   he had no comfortable family standing  behind him  and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government  to be blown anywhere about the world     but he didn   t despise himself and it didn   t turn out as he had  imagined  he had intended  probably  to take what he could and go   but  now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a  grail  he knew that daisy was extraordinary  but he didn   t realize  just how extraordinary a    nice    girl could be  she vanished into her  rich house  into her rich  full life  leaving gatsby   nothing  he felt  married to her  that was all     when they met again  two days later  it was gatsby who was breathless   who was  somehow  betrayed  her porch was bright with the bought  luxury of star shine  the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as  she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth  she  had caught a cold  and it made her voice huskier and more charming  than ever  and gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and  mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves  of the freshness of many  clothes  and of daisy  gleaming like silver  safe and proud above the  hot struggles of the poor                                                                                    i can   t describe to you how surprised i was to find out i loved her   old sport  i even hoped for a while that she   d throw me over  but she  didn   t  because she was in love with me too  she thought i knew a lot  because i knew different things from her   ¦ well  there i was  way off  my ambitions  getting deeper in love every minute  and all of a sudden  i didn   t care  what was the use of doing great things if i could have  a better time telling her what i was going to do        on the last afternoon before he went abroad  he sat with daisy in his  arms for a long  silent time  it was a cold fall day  with fire in the  room and her cheeks flushed  now and then she moved and he changed his  arm a little  and once he kissed her dark shining hair  the afternoon  had made them tranquil for a while  as if to give them a deep memory  for the long parting the next day promised  they had never been closer  in their month of love  nor communicated more profoundly one with  another  than when she brushed silent lips against his coat   s shoulder  or when he touched the end of her fingers  gently  as though she were  asleep                                                                                 he did extraordinarily well in the war  he was a captain before he  went to the front  and following the argonne battles he got his  majority and the command of the divisional machine guns  after the  armistice he tried frantically to get home  but some complication or  misunderstanding sent him to oxford instead  he was worried now   there  was a quality of nervous despair in daisy   s letters  she didn   t see  why he couldn   t come  she was feeling the pressure of the world  outside  and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her  and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all     for daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids  and pleasant  cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of  the year  summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new  tunes  all night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the     beale street blues    while a hundred pairs of golden and silver  slippers shuffled the shining dust  at the grey tea hour there were  always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low  sweet fever   while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the  sad horns around the floor     through this twilight universe daisy began to move again with the  season  suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with  half a dozen men  and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and  chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor  beside her bed  and all the time something within her was crying for a  decision  she wanted her life shaped now  immediately   and the decision  must be made by some force   of love  of money  of unquestionable  practicality   that was close at hand     that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of tom  buchanan  there was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his  position  and daisy was flattered  doubtless there was a certain  struggle and a certain relief  the letter reached gatsby while he was  still at oxford                                                                                 it was dawn now on long island and we went about opening the rest of  the windows downstairs  filling the house with grey turning   gold turning light  the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew  and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves  there was a  slow  pleasant movement in the air  scarcely a wind  promising a cool   lovely day        i don   t think she ever loved him     gatsby turned around from a window  and looked at me challengingly     you must remember  old sport  she was  very excited this afternoon  he told her those things in a way that  frightened her   that made it look as if i was some kind of cheap  sharper  and the result was she hardly knew what she was saying        he sat down gloomily        of course she might have loved him just for a minute  when they were  first married   and loved me more even then  do you see        suddenly he came out with a curious remark        in any case     he said     it was just personal        what could you make of that  except to suspect some intensity in his  conception of the affair that couldn   t be measured     he came back from france when tom and daisy were still on their  wedding trip  and made a miserable but irresistible journey to  louisville on the last of his army pay  he stayed there a week   walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through  the november night and revisiting the out of the way places to which  they had driven in her white car  just as daisy   s house had always  seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses  so his idea  of the city itself  even though she was gone from it  was pervaded  with a melancholy beauty     he left feeling that if he had searched harder  he might have found  her   that he was leaving her behind  the day coach   he was penniless  now   was hot  he went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a  folding chair  and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar  buildings moved by  then out into the spring fields  where a yellow  trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have  seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street     the track curved and now it was going away from the sun  which  as it  sank lower  seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing  city where she had drawn her breath  he stretched out his hand  desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air  to save a fragment of  the spot that she had made lovely for him  but it was all going by too  fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part  of it  the freshest and the best  forever     it was nine o   clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the  porch  the night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there  was an autumn flavour in the air  the gardener  the last one of  gatsby   s former servants  came to the foot of the steps        i   m going to drain the pool today  mr  gatsby  leaves   ll start  falling pretty soon  and then there   s always trouble with the pipes           don   t do it today     gatsby answered  he turned to me apologetically      you know  old sport  i   ve never used that pool all summer        i looked at my watch and stood up        twelve minutes to my train        i didn   t want to go to the city  i wasn   t worth a decent stroke of  work  but it was more than that   i didn   t want to leave gatsby  i  missed that train  and then another  before i could get myself away        i   ll call you up     i said finally        do  old sport           i   ll call you about noon        we walked slowly down the steps        i suppose daisy   ll call too     he looked at me anxiously  as if he  hoped i   d corroborate this        i suppose so           well  goodbye        we shook hands and i started away  just before i reached the hedge i  remembered something and turned around        they   re a rotten crowd     i shouted across the lawn     you   re worth the  whole damn bunch put together        i   ve always been glad i said that  it was the only compliment i ever  gave him  because i disapproved of him from beginning to end  first he  nodded politely  and then his face broke into that radiant and  understanding smile  as if we   d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact  all the time  his gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of  colour against the white steps  and i thought of the night when i  first came to his ancestral home  three months before  the lawn and  drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his  corruption   and he had stood on those steps  concealing his  incorruptible dream  as he waved them goodbye     i thanked him for his hospitality  we were always thanking him for  that   i and the others        goodbye     i called     i enjoyed breakfast  gatsby                                                                                    up in the city  i tried for a while to list the quotations on an  interminable amount of stock  then i fell asleep in my swivel chair   just before noon the phone woke me  and i started up with sweat  breaking out on my forehead  it was jordan baker  she often called me  up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between  hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other  way  usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool   as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the  office window  but this morning it seemed harsh and dry        i   ve left daisy   s house     she said     i   m at hempstead  and i   m going  down to southampton this afternoon        probably it had been tactful to leave daisy   s house  but the act  annoyed me  and her next remark made me rigid        you weren   t so nice to me last night           how could it have mattered then        silence for a moment  then        however   i want to see you           i want to see you  too           suppose i don   t go to southampton  and come into town this  afternoon           no   i don   t think this afternoon           very well           it   s impossible this afternoon  various          we talked like that for a while  and then abruptly we weren   t talking  any longer  i don   t know which of us hung up with a sharp click  but i  know i didn   t care  i couldn   t have talked to her across a tea table  that day if i never talked to her again in this world     i called gatsby   s house a few minutes later  but the line was busy  i  tried four times  finally an exasperated central told me the wire was  being kept open for long distance from detroit  taking out my  timetable  i drew a small circle around the three fifty train  then i  leaned back in my chair and tried to think  it was just noon                                                                                 when i passed the ash heaps on the train that morning i had crossed  deliberately to the other side of the car  i supposed there   d be a  curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark  spots in the dust  and some garrulous man telling over and over what  had happened  until it became less and less real even to him and he  could tell it no longer  and myrtle wilson   s tragic achievement was  forgotten  now i want to go back a little and tell what happened at  the garage after we left there the night before     they had difficulty in locating the sister  catherine  she must have  broken her rule against drinking that night  for when she arrived she  was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had  already gone to flushing  when they convinced her of this  she  immediately fainted  as if that was the intolerable part of the  affair  someone  kind or curious  took her in his car and drove her in  the wake of her sister   s body     until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front  of the garage  while george wilson rocked himself back and forth on  the couch inside  for a while the door of the office was open  and  everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it   finally someone said it was a shame  and closed the door  michaelis  and several other men were with him  first  four or five men  later  two or three men  still later michaelis had to ask the last stranger  to wait there fifteen minutes longer  while he went back to his own  place and made a pot of coffee  after that  he stayed there alone with  wilson until dawn     about three o   clock the quality of wilson   s incoherent muttering  changed   he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car  he  announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car  belonged to  and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his  wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose  swollen     but when he heard himself say this  he flinched and began to cry    oh   my god     again in his groaning voice  michaelis made a clumsy attempt  to distract him        how long have you been married  george  come on there  try and sit  still a minute  and answer my question  how long have you been  married           twelve years           ever had any children  come on  george  sit still   i asked you a  question  did you ever have any children        the hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light  and  whenever michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it  sounded to him like the car that hadn   t stopped a few hours before   he didn   t like to go into the garage  because the work bench was  stained where the body had been lying  so he moved uncomfortably  around the office   he knew every object in it before morning   and from  time to time sat down beside wilson trying to keep him more quiet        have you got a church you go to sometimes  george  maybe even if you  haven   t been there for a long time  maybe i could call up the church  and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you  see           don   t belong to any           you ought to have a church  george  for times like this  you must  have gone to church once  didn   t you get married in a church  listen   george  listen to me  didn   t you get married in a church           that was a long time ago        the effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking   for a moment  he was silent  then the same half knowing  half bewildered look came  back into his faded eyes        look in the drawer there     he said  pointing at the desk        which drawer           that drawer   that one        michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand  there was nothing in it  but a small  expensive dog leash  made of leather and braided  silver  it was apparently new        this     he inquired  holding it up     wilson stared and nodded        i found it yesterday afternoon  she tried to tell me about it  but i  knew it was something funny           you mean your wife bought it           she had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau        michaelis didn   t see anything odd in that  and he gave wilson a dozen  reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash  but conceivably  wilson had heard some of these same explanations before  from myrtle   because he began saying    oh  my god     again in a whisper   his comforter  left several explanations in the air        then he killed her     said wilson  his mouth dropped open suddenly        who did           i have a way of finding out           you   re morbid  george     said his friend     this has been a strain to  you and you don   t know what you   re saying  you   d better try and sit  quiet till morning           he murdered her           it was an accident  george        wilson shook his head  his eyes narrowed and his mouth widened  slightly with the ghost of a superior    hm           i know     he said definitely     i   m one of these trusting fellas and i  don   t think any harm to nobody  but when i get to know a thing i know  it  it was the man in that car  she ran out to speak to him and he  wouldn   t stop        michaelis had seen this too  but it hadn   t occurred to him that there  was any special significance in it  he believed that mrs  wilson had  been running away from her husband  rather than trying to stop any  particular car        how could she of been like that           she   s a deep one     said wilson  as if that answered the question      ah h h          he began to rock again  and michaelis stood twisting the leash in his  hand        maybe you got some friend that i could telephone for  george        this was a forlorn hope   he was almost sure that wilson had no friend   there was not enough of him for his wife  he was glad a little later  when he noticed a change in the room  a blue quickening by the window   and realized that dawn wasn   t far off  about five o   clock it was blue  enough outside to snap off the light     wilson   s glazed eyes turned out to the ash heaps  where small grey  clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the  faint dawn wind        i spoke to her     he muttered  after a long silence     i told her she  might fool me but she couldn   t fool god  i took her to the  window      with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and  leaned with his face pressed against it      and i said   god knows what  you   ve been doing  everything you   ve been doing  you may fool me  but  you can   t fool god             standing behind him  michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at  the eyes of doctor t  j  eckleburg  which had just emerged  pale and  enormous  from the dissolving night        god sees everything     repeated wilson        that   s an advertisement     michaelis assured him  something made him  turn away from the window and look back into the room  but wilson  stood there a long time  his face close to the window pane  nodding  into the twilight                                                                                 by six o   clock michaelis was worn out  and grateful for the sound of a  car stopping outside  it was one of the watchers of the night before  who had promised to come back  so he cooked breakfast for three  which  he and the other man ate together  wilson was quieter now  and  michaelis went home to sleep  when he awoke four hours later and  hurried back to the garage  wilson was gone     his movements   he was on foot all the time   were afterward traced to  port roosevelt and then to gad   s hill  where he bought a sandwich that  he didn   t eat  and a cup of coffee  he must have been tired and  walking slowly  for he didn   t reach gad   s hill until noon  thus far  there was no difficulty in accounting for his time   there were boys who  had seen a man    acting sort of crazy     and motorists at whom he stared  oddly from the side of the road  then for three hours he disappeared  from view  the police  on the strength of what he said to michaelis   that he    had a way of finding out     supposed that he spent that time  going from garage to garage thereabout  inquiring for a yellow car  on  the other hand  no garage man who had seen him ever came forward  and  perhaps he had an easier  surer way of finding out what he wanted to  know  by half past two he was in west egg  where he asked someone the  way to gatsby   s house  so by that time he knew gatsby   s name                                                                                 at two o   clock gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the  butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the  pool  he stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had  amused his guests during the summer  and the chauffeur helped him to  pump it up  then he gave instructions that the open car wasn   t to be  taken out under any circumstances   and this was strange  because the  front right fender needed repair     gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool  once he  stopped and shifted it a little  and the chauffeur asked him if he  needed help  but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among  the yellowing trees     no telephone message arrived  but the butler went without his sleep  and waited for it until four o   clock   until long after there was anyone  to give it to if it came  i have an idea that gatsby himself didn   t  believe it would come  and perhaps he no longer cared  if that was  true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world  paid a  high price for living too long with a single dream  he must have  looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered  as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight  was upon the scarcely created grass  a new world  material without  being real  where poor ghosts  breathing dreams like air  drifted  fortuitously about   ¦ like that ashen  fantastic figure gliding toward  him through the amorphous trees     the chauffeur   he was one of wolfshiem   s protã©gã©s   heard the  shots   afterwards he could only say that he hadn   t thought anything  much about them  i drove from the station directly to gatsby   s house  and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that  alarmed anyone  but they knew then  i firmly believe  with scarcely a  word said  four of us  the chauffeur  butler  gardener  and i hurried  down to the pool     there was a faint  barely perceptible movement of the water as the  fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other   with little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves  the laden  mattress moved irregularly down the pool  a small gust of wind that  scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental  course with its accidental burden  the touch of a cluster of leaves  revolved it slowly  tracing  like the leg of transit  a thin red  circle in the water     it was after we started with gatsby toward the house that the gardener  saw wilson   s body a little way off in the grass  and the holocaust was  complete                                         ix    after two years i remember the rest of that day  and that night and  the next day  only as an endless drill of police and photographers and  newspaper men in and out of gatsby   s front door  a rope stretched  across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious  but  little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard  and  there were always a few of them clustered open mouthed about the  pool  someone with a positive manner  perhaps a detective  used the  expression    madman    as he bent over wilson   s body that afternoon  and  the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper  reports next morning     most of those reports were a nightmare   grotesque  circumstantial   eager  and untrue  when michaelis   s testimony at the inquest brought  to light wilson   s suspicions of his wife i thought the whole tale  would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade   but catherine  who might  have said anything  didn   t say a word  she showed a surprising amount  of character about it too   looked at the coroner with determined eyes  under that corrected brow of hers  and swore that her sister had never  seen gatsby  that her sister was completely happy with her husband   that her sister had been into no mischief whatever  she convinced  herself of it  and cried into her handkerchief  as if the very  suggestion was more than she could endure  so wilson was reduced to a  man    deranged by grief    in order that the case might remain in its  simplest form  and it rested there     but all this part of it seemed remote and unessential  i found myself  on gatsby   s side  and alone  from the moment i telephoned news of the  catastrophe to west egg village  every surmise about him  and every  practical question  was referred to me  at first i was surprised and  confused  then  as he lay in his house and didn   t move or breathe or  speak  hour upon hour  it grew upon me that i was responsible  because  no one else was interested   interested  i mean  with that intense  personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end     i called up daisy half an hour after we found him  called her  instinctively and without hesitation  but she and tom had gone away  early that afternoon  and taken baggage with them        left no address           no           say when they   d be back           no           any idea where they are  how i could reach them           i don   t know  can   t say        i wanted to get somebody for him  i wanted to go into the room where  he lay and reassure him     i   ll get somebody for you  gatsby  don   t  worry  just trust me and i   ll get somebody for you          meyer wolfshiem   s name wasn   t in the phone book  the butler gave me  his office address on broadway  and i called information  but by the  time i had the number it was long after five  and no one answered the  phone        will you ring again           i   ve rung three times           it   s very important           sorry  i   m afraid no one   s there        i went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they  were chance visitors  all these official people who suddenly filled  it  but  though they drew back the sheet and looked at gatsby with  shocked eyes  his protest continued in my brain        look here  old sport  you   ve got to get somebody for me  you   ve got  to try hard  i can   t go through this alone        someone started to ask me questions  but i broke away and going  upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk   he   d  never told me definitely that his parents were dead  but there was  nothing   only the picture of dan cody  a token of forgotten violence   staring down from the wall     next morning i sent the butler to new york with a letter to wolfshiem   which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next  train  that request seemed superfluous when i wrote it  i was sure  he   d start when he saw the newspapers  just as i was sure there   d be a  wire from daisy before noon   but neither a wire nor mr  wolfshiem  arrived  no one arrived except more police and photographers and  newspaper men  when the butler brought back wolfshiem   s answer i began  to have a feeling of defiance  of scornful solidarity between gatsby  and me against them all      dear mr  carraway  this has been one of the most terrible shocks of   my life to me i hardly can believe it that it is true at all  such a   mad act as that man did should make us all think  i cannot come down   now as i am tied up in some very important business and cannot get   mixed up in this thing now  if there is anything i can do a little   later let me know in a letter by edgar  i hardly know where i am when   i hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and   out                                    yours truly                                 meyer wolfshiem    and then hasty addenda beneath      let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all     when the phone rang that afternoon and long distance said chicago was  calling i thought this would be daisy at last  but the connection came  through as a man   s voice  very thin and far away        this is slagle speaking   ¦          yes     the name was unfamiliar        hell of a note  isn   t it  get my wire           there haven   t been any wires           young parke   s in trouble     he said rapidly     they picked him up when  he handed the bonds over the counter  they got a circular from new  york giving    em the numbers just five minutes before  what d   you know  about that  hey  you never can tell in these hick towns             hello     i interrupted breathlessly     look here   this isn   t mr   gatsby  mr  gatsby   s dead        there was a long silence on the other end of the wire  followed by an  exclamation   ¦ then a quick squawk as the connection was broken                                                                                 i think it was on the third day that a telegram signed henry c  gatz  arrived from a town in minnesota  it said only that the sender was  leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came     it was gatsby   s father  a solemn old man  very helpless and dismayed   bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm september day  his  eyes leaked continuously with excitement  and when i took the bag and  umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse  grey beard that i had difficulty in getting off his coat  he was on  the point of collapse  so i took him into the music room and made him  sit down while i sent for something to eat  but he wouldn   t eat  and  the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand        i saw it in the chicago newspaper     he said     it was all in the  chicago newspaper  i started right away           i didn   t know how to reach you        his eyes  seeing nothing  moved ceaselessly about the room        it was a madman     he said     he must have been mad           wouldn   t you like some coffee     i urged him        i don   t want anything  i   m all right now  mr              carraway           well  i   m all right now  where have they got jimmy        i took him into the drawing room  where his son lay  and left him  there  some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into  the hall  when i told them who had arrived  they went reluctantly  away     after a little while mr  gatz opened the door and came out  his mouth  ajar  his face flushed slightly  his eyes leaking isolated and  unpunctual tears  he had reached an age where death no longer has the  quality of ghastly surprise  and when he looked around him now for the  first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great  rooms opening out from it into other rooms  his grief began to be  mixed with an awed pride  i helped him to a bedroom upstairs  while he  took off his coat and vest i told him that all arrangements had been  deferred until he came        i didn   t know what you   d want  mr  gatsby             gatz is my name              mr  gatz  i thought you might want to take the body west        he shook his head        jimmy always liked it better down east  he rose up to his position in  the east  were you a friend of my boy   s  mr               we were close friends           he had a big future before him  you know  he was only a young man   but he had a lot of brain power here        he touched his head impressively  and i nodded        if he   d of lived  he   d of been a great man  a man like james j   hill  he   d of helped build up the country           that   s true     i said  uncomfortably     he fumbled at the embroidered coverlet  trying to take it from the  bed  and lay down stiffly   was instantly asleep     that night an obviously frightened person called up  and demanded to  know who i was before he would give his name        this is mr  carraway     i said        oh     he sounded relieved     this is klipspringer        i was relieved too  for that seemed to promise another friend at  gatsby   s grave  i didn   t want it to be in the papers and draw a  sightseeing crowd  so i   d been calling up a few people myself  they  were hard to find        the funeral   s tomorrow     i said     three o   clock  here at the house   i wish you   d tell anybody who   d be interested           oh  i will     he broke out hastily     of course i   m not likely to see  anybody  but if i do        his tone made me suspicious        of course you   ll be there yourself           well  i   ll certainly try  what i called up about is             wait a minute     i interrupted     how about saying you   ll come           well  the fact is   the truth of the matter is that i   m staying with  some people up here in greenwich  and they rather expect me to be with  them tomorrow  in fact  there   s a sort of picnic or something  of  course i   ll do my best to get away        i ejaculated an unrestrained    huh     and he must have heard me  for he  went on nervously        what i called up about was a pair of shoes i left there  i wonder if  it   d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on  you see   they   re tennis shoes  and i   m sort of helpless without them  my  address is care of b  f           i didn   t hear the rest of the name  because i hung up the receiver     after that i felt a certain shame for gatsby   one gentleman to whom i  telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved  however  that was  my fault  for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at  gatsby on the courage of gatsby   s liquor  and i should have known  better than to call him     the morning of the funeral i went up to new york to see meyer  wolfshiem  i couldn   t seem to reach him any other way  the door that i  pushed open  on the advice of an elevator boy  was marked    the  swastika holding company     and at first there didn   t seem to be anyone  inside  but when i   d shouted    hello    several times in vain  an  argument broke out behind a partition  and presently a lovely jewess  appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile  eyes        nobody   s in     she said     mr  wolfshiem   s gone to chicago        the first part of this was obviously untrue  for someone had begun to  whistle    the rosary     tunelessly  inside        please say that mr  carraway wants to see him           i can   t get him back from chicago  can i        at this moment a voice  unmistakably wolfshiem   s  called    stella      from the other side of the door        leave your name on the desk     she said quickly     i   ll give it to him  when he gets back           but i know he   s there        she took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up  and down her hips        you young men think you can force your way in here any time     she  scolded     we   re getting sickantired of it  when i say he   s in chicago   he   s in chicago        i mentioned gatsby        oh h     she looked at me over again     will you just   what was your  name        she vanished  in a moment meyer wolfshiem stood solemnly in the  doorway  holding out both hands  he drew me into his office  remarking  in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us  and offered  me a cigar        my memory goes back to when first i met him     he said     a young major  just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war   he was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he  couldn   t buy some regular clothes  first time i saw him was when he  came into winebrenner   s poolroom at forty third street and asked for a  job  he hadn   t eat anything for a couple of days    come on have some  lunch with me     i said  he ate more than four dollars    worth of food  in half an hour           did you start him in business     i inquired        start him  i made him           oh           i raised him up out of nothing  right out of the gutter  i saw right  away he was a fine appearing  gentlemanly young man  and when he told  me he was at oggsford i knew i could use him good  i got him to join  the american legion and he used to stand high there  right off he did  some work for a client of mine up to albany  we were so thick like  that in everything      he held up two bulbous fingers      always together        i wondered if this partnership had included the world   s series  transaction in 1919        now he   s dead     i said after a moment     you were his closest friend   so i know you   ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon           i   d like to come           well  come then        the hair in his nostrils quivered slightly  and as he shook his head  his eyes filled with tears        i can   t do it   i can   t get mixed up in it     he said        there   s nothing to get mixed up in  it   s all over now           when a man gets killed i never like to get mixed up in it in any  way  i keep out  when i was a young man it was different   if a friend  of mine died  no matter how  i stuck with them to the end  you may  think that   s sentimental  but i mean it   to the bitter end        i saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come   so i stood up        are you a college man     he inquired suddenly     for a moment i thought he was going to suggest a    gonnegtion     but he  only nodded and shook my hand        let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and  not after he is dead     he suggested     after that my own rule is to let  everything alone        when i left his office the sky had turned dark and i got back to west  egg in a drizzle  after changing my clothes i went next door and found  mr  gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall  his pride in his  son and in his son   s possessions was continually increasing and now he  had something to show me        jimmy sent me this picture     he took out his wallet with trembling  fingers     look there        it was a photograph of the house  cracked in the corners and dirty  with many hands  he pointed out every detail to me eagerly     look  there     and then sought admiration from my eyes  he had shown it so  often that i think it was more real to him now than the house itself        jimmy sent it to me  i think it   s a very pretty picture  it shows up  well           very well  had you seen him lately           he come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house i live in  now  of course we was broke up when he run off from home  but i see  now there was a reason for it  he knew he had a big future in front of  him  and ever since he made a success he was very generous with me        he seemed reluctant to put away the picture  held it for another  minute  lingeringly  before my eyes  then he returned the wallet and  pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called hopalong  cassidy        look here  this is a book he had when he was a boy  it just shows  you        he opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see  on  the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule  and the date september  12  1906  and underneath         rise from bed                                  6 00      a m       dumbell exercise and wall scaling              6 15 6 30          study electricity  etc

book by accident     said the old man     it just  shows you  don   t it           it just shows you           jimmy was bound to get ahead  he always had some resolves like this  or something  do you notice what he   s got about improving his mind  he  was always great for that  he told me i et like a hog once  and i beat  him for it        he was reluctant to close the book  reading each item aloud and then  looking eagerly at me  i think he rather expected me to copy down the  list for my own use     a little before three the lutheran minister arrived from flushing  and  i began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars  so did  gatsby   s father  and as the time passed and the servants came in and  stood waiting in the hall  his eyes began to blink anxiously  and he  spoke of the rain in a worried  uncertain way  the minister glanced  several times at his watch  so i took him aside and asked him to wait  for half an hour  but it wasn   t any use  nobody came                                                                                 about five o   clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery  and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate   first a motor hearse   horribly black and wet  then mr  gatz and the minister and me in the  limousine  and a little later four or five servants and the postman  from west egg  in gatsby   s station wagon  all wet to the skin  as we  started through the gate into the cemetery i heard a car stop and then  the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground  i  looked around  it was the man with owl eyed glasses whom i had found  marvelling over gatsby   s books in the library one night three months  before     i   d never seen him since then  i don   t know how he knew about the  funeral  or even his name  the rain poured down his thick glasses  and  he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled  from gatsby   s grave     i tried to think about gatsby then for a moment  but he was already  too far away  and i could only remember  without resentment  that  daisy hadn   t sent a message or a flower  dimly i heard someone murmur     blessed are the dead that the rain falls on     and then the owl eyed  man said    amen to that     in a brave voice     we straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars  owl eyes spoke  to me by the gate        i couldn   t get to the house     he remarked        neither could anybody else           go on     he started     why  my god  they used to go there by the  hundreds        he took off his glasses and wiped them again  outside and in        the poor son of a bitch     he said                                                                                 one of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school  and later from college at christmas time  those who went farther than  chicago would gather in the old dim union station at six o   clock of a  december evening  with a few chicago friends  already caught up into  their own holiday gaieties  to bid them a hasty goodbye  i remember  the fur coats of the girls returning from miss this or that   s and the  chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught  sight of old acquaintances  and the matchings of invitations     are you  going to the ordways     the herseys     the schultzes        and the long  green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands  and last the murky  yellow cars of the chicago  milwaukee and st  paul railroad looking  cheerful as christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate     when we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow  our snow   began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows  and  the dim lights of small wisconsin stations moved by  a sharp wild  brace came suddenly into the air  we drew in deep breaths of it as we  walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules  unutterably aware  of our identity with this country for one strange hour  before we  melted indistinguishably into it again     that   s my middle west   not the wheat or the prairies or the lost swede  towns  but the thrilling returning trains of my youth  and the street  lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly  wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow  i am part of that  a  little solemn with the feel of those long winters  a little complacent  from growing up in the carraway house in a city where dwellings are  still called through decades by a family   s name  i see now that this  has been a story of the west  after all   tom and gatsby  daisy and  jordan and i  were all westerners  and perhaps we possessed some  deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to eastern life     even when the east excited me most  even when i was most keenly aware  of its superiority to the bored  sprawling  swollen towns beyond the  ohio  with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the  children and the very old   even then it had always for me a quality of  distortion  west egg  especially  still figures in my more fantastic  dreams  i see it as a night scene by el greco  a hundred houses  at  once conventional and grotesque  crouching under a sullen  overhanging  sky and a lustreless moon  in the foreground four solemn men in dress  suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a  drunken woman in a white evening dress  her hand  which dangles over  the side  sparkles cold with jewels  gravely the men turn in at a  house   the wrong house  but no one knows the woman   s name  and no one  cares     after gatsby   s death the east was haunted for me like that  distorted  beyond my eyes    power of correction  so when the blue smoke of brittle  leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the  line i decided to come back home     there was one thing to be done before i left  an awkward  unpleasant  thing that perhaps had better have been let alone  but i wanted to  leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent  sea to sweep my refuse away  i saw jordan baker and talked over and  around what had happened to us together  and what had happened  afterward to me  and she lay perfectly still  listening  in a big  chair     she was dressed to play golf  and i remember thinking she looked like  a good illustration  her chin raised a little jauntily  her hair the  colour of an autumn leaf  her face the same brown tint as the  fingerless glove on her knee  when i had finished she told me without  comment that she was engaged to another man  i doubted that  though  there were several she could have married at a nod of her head  but i  pretended to be surprised  for just a minute i wondered if i wasn   t  making a mistake  then i thought it all over again quickly and got up  to say goodbye        nevertheless you did throw me over     said jordan suddenly     you threw  me over on the telephone  i don   t give a damn about you now  but it  was a new experience for me  and i felt a little dizzy for a while        we shook hands        oh  and do you remember      she added      a conversation we had once about  driving a car           why   not exactly           you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver   well  i met another bad driver  didn   t i  i mean it was careless of me  to make such a wrong guess  i thought you were rather an honest   straightforward person  i thought it was your secret pride           i   m thirty     i said     i   m five years too old to lie to myself and  call it honour        she didn   t answer  angry  and half in love with her  and tremendously  sorry  i turned away                                                                                 one afternoon late in october i saw tom buchanan  he was walking ahead  of me along fifth avenue in his alert  aggressive way  his hands out a  little from his body as if to fight off interference  his head moving  sharply here and there  adapting itself to his restless eyes  just as  i slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into  the windows of a jewellery store  suddenly he saw me and walked back   holding out his hand        what   s the matter  nick  do you object to shaking hands with me           yes  you know what i think of you           you   re crazy  nick     he said quickly     crazy as hell  i don   t know  what   s the matter with you           tom     i inquired     what did you say to wilson that afternoon        he stared at me without a word  and i knew i had guessed right about  those missing hours  i started to turn away  but he took a step after  me and grabbed my arm        i told him the truth     he said     he came to the door while we were  getting ready to leave  and when i sent down word that we weren   t in  he tried to force his way upstairs  he was crazy enough to kill me if  i hadn   t told him who owned the car  his hand was on a revolver in his  pocket every minute he was in the house       he broke off defiantly      what if i did tell him  that fellow had it coming to him  he threw  dust into your eyes just like he did in daisy   s  but he was a tough  one  he ran over myrtle like you   d run over a dog and never even  stopped his car        there was nothing i could say  except the one unutterable fact that it  wasn   t true        and if you think i didn   t have my share of suffering   look here  when  i went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits  sitting there on the sideboard  i sat down and cried like a baby  by  god it was awful          i couldn   t forgive him or like him  but i saw that what he had done  was  to him  entirely justified  it was all very careless and  confused  they were careless people  tom and daisy   they smashed up  things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their  vast carelessness  or whatever it was that kept them together  and let  other people clean up the mess they had made   ¦    i shook hands with him  it seemed silly not to  for i felt suddenly as  though i were talking to a child  then he went into the jewellery  store to buy a pearl necklace   or perhaps only a pair of cuff  buttons   rid of my provincial squeamishness forever                                                                                 gatsby   s house was still empty when i left   the grass on his lawn had  grown as long as mine  one of the taxi drivers in the village never  took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and  pointing inside  perhaps it was he who drove daisy and gatsby over to  east egg the night of the accident  and perhaps he had made a story  about it all his own  i didn   t want to hear it and i avoided him when  i got off the train     i spent my saturday nights in new york because those gleaming   dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that i could still  hear the music and the laughter  faint and incessant  from his garden   and the cars going up and down his drive  one night i did hear a  material car there  and saw its lights stop at his front steps  but i  didn   t investigate  probably it was some final guest who had been away  at the ends of the earth and didn   t know that the party was over     on the last night  with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer   i went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once  more  on the white steps an obscene word  scrawled by some boy with a  piece of brick  stood out clearly in the moonlight  and i erased it   drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone  then i wandered down to the  beach and sprawled out on the sand     most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any  lights except the shadowy  moving glow of a ferryboat across the  sound  and as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to  melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that  flowered once for dutch sailors    eyes   a fresh  green breast of the new  world  its vanished trees  the trees that had made way for gatsby   s  house  had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all  human dreams  for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his  breath in the presence of this continent  compelled into an aesthetic  contemplation he neither understood nor desired  face to face for the  last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for  wonder     and as i sat there brooding on the old  unknown world  i thought of  gatsby   s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of  daisy   s dock  he had come a long way to this blue lawn  and his dream  must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it  he  did not know that it was already behind him  somewhere back in that  vast obscurity beyond the city  where the dark fields of the republic  rolled on under the night     gatsby believed in the green light  the orgastic future that year by  year recedes before us  it eluded us then  but that   s no  matter   tomorrow we will run faster  stretch out our arms further   ¦ and  one fine morning       so we beat on  boats against the current  borne back ceaselessly into  the past         end of the project gutenberg ebook the great gatsby        updated
