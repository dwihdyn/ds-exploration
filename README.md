### Data Science Principle :

- Do whole OSEMN at bare minimum, and then find way to improve accuracy on test data
- Data Science is **_just a tool_** to solve a problem. just like software developer, you DONT need to create everything from scratch. sometimes theres better solution out there already
- find a problem first in a business, then ask youself "can you solve this using data science tools OR can be fix easily without it?"
- where to buy data (data vendors/brokers) ?
  - general : nielsen
  - fashion : omnilytics
  - best method is actually collect your own data in your mobile apps (eg : grab, bigpay, MAE maybank)
